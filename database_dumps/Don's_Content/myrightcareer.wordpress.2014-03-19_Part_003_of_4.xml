Click on the link above to see a video where Don describes the Autobiography  concept and explains your Exercise via some examples.

If you would like to have a copy of the presentation in front of you while viewing the video you can click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Student-Autobiography_PP.pdf"target="_blank">PowerPoint File (pdf)</a> to view a pdf version of the PowerPoint file used during the video presentation. You can then view, print or download the file.  

At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Write an autobiography & provide insights, 2) Document the transitions & provide insights, 3) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 4) Provide feedback, 5) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator and 6) Become an example.
<ul>
</ul>
In Step 4 you will be asked for your Feedback. If you want to look at the Survey, without actually taking it, click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Survey-MyRC-Autobiography-Maddie.pdf"target="_blank">Autobiography Survey - pdf version.</a> You may want to do this so you can see, before you start the exercise, the types of questions you will be asked to answer after completing the exercise. Don't use this to provide feedback.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Autobiography Approach</strong></h1>
So quickly what you are doing is looking back at your life to see if you can gain any insights that will help you identify what you want to do going forward. 

You will be doing this by documenting your life in a short Autobiography, in outline format. You will then look at all the Transitions you have made in your life. Using both of these you will look at the insights you can draw.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Assignment</strong></h1>
Now you get to put these concepts into play for your life. It works best if you print out these instructions and then use the Web site while looking at the printed instructions.
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Resources to help you</strong></h2>
</li>
<strong>Examples</strong>:One of the best ways to do this exercise is to look at how others have done the exercise. There is an exercise from Don in all of the Assignments and it is the most complete exercise. You do not have to have your exercise be as complete as his, but it is useful as an example. The other examples are more representative of what a typical college student would do. The examples can be found on the Autobiography Examples page in the Sub Navigation section on the right hand side of this page.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Templates</strong>: There is a Word template for the Autobiography document. It can be found on the Autobiography Templates page in the Sub Navigation section on the right hand side of this page. The other documents don't require templates.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Video & Presentation</strong>: For those of you who learn better by listening to a presentation, instead of reading instructions, you can watch the Welcome to the Autobiography Exercise video again. You might want a hard copy of the presentation in front of you so you can make notes on it. The Welcome to the Autobiography Exercise Video is about 5 minutes long so it will not take long to review it again. You can pause at any point and back up if necessary. You can find both of them at the top of this page:
- Video: you can click on the Welcome to the Autobiography Exercise Video link at any time to listen & view the video again.
- Presentation: you can click on the PowerPoint file link to view, print or download the pdf version of the PowerPoint file at any time.
<ul>
</ul>


	<li><h2><strong>1) Write an Autobiography and Provide Insights</strong></h2></li>

<h3><strong>Autobiography Structure</strong></h3>

Here are some elements I would like you to use, but you are free to do this anyway you find easiest. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography</a> to see an example of an Autobiography. It follows the recommended structure.

- <strong>Use an Outline format</strong>. Generally you don't need to use more than one line to describe each item, e.g. "Father quit Caterpillar and bought Varna Heating & Electric"; Merging our 13 kids with Lacon's 27 kids to make our 7th grade; Winning State Baseball Championship; Being in the Junior Play; Mr. Waxler said I should be an engineer so I went to Rose Poly. 

You are not writing this so someone else can read it. You know there is a story behind each of those one line statements. When you get famous you can use this as the outline for your Autobiography and then you (or your ghost writer) can write the prose that will let the rest of us understand your life. With Word you can have as many levels of indentation as you want if that helps communicate meaning.

- <strong>Have a separate page for each element of your Life Framework.</strong>  Casey's has a page for Ancestors, a page for Elementary through High School and a page for College. This lets you work on them separately – adding, deleting and changing material.

- <strong>Keep your Personal and Professional elements separate.</strong> For example in Don's he has a Personal - College and a Professional - College. You could just put everything in Personal but it will help you later identifying your Right Career by having a Professional category. Examples of items that are in Don's "Professional - College" are: Summer Job at Detroit Edison, Founding College Newspaper and Managing construction of Fraternity Homecoming Display.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Autobiography Approach</strong></h3>

Here is a tops down approach for writing your autobiography:

- <strong>High Level</strong> First, start with a high level version. Don’t try to put down detail until you get the overall structure in place. Now you have an outline and can fill in details. This is the way writing coaches suggest a book be written.
<ul>
</ul>
- Family:  Parents, Siblings
- Elementary School, Middle School (6th, 7th & 8th), High School (9th, 10th, 11th & 12th) 
- College:  Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior

- <strong>Put in some Detail</strong> Second, put in some detail so you have the start of your autobiography, e.g. on the professional side you want some detail below high school and college, while on the personal side you may want to have some level of personal detail on all of them. 

- <strong>Drill Down</strong> Third, pick a few areas and drill down in them. You will gain insights just by what areas you choose to dive down into (they show your interests). This is not about writing down everything that has happened in your life.

- <strong>Summary</strong>: You probably don’t want to have the same level of detail for every area. In the past one mistake I have seen people make is just starting to write and running out of steam about half way through. They ended up with way too much detail on the early parts of their life. One person did an elaborate history of their very large family and then later realized it was not really very valuable. In retrospect they realized it was not going to be valuable but they found writing the history very interesting.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Autobiography Insights</strong></h3>
Here are are different ways to help you gain some insights into your autobiography.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Look for Themes</strong></h4>
Below are some different ways of gaining insights from your autobiography taken from the book "What Now" by Laura Fortgang:

Take a look at any <strong>"Golden Threads" </strong>that may run through your life, e.g.
- Interests, e.g. environment, politics, technology
- Kinds of roles, e.g. leader, follower, avoid getting involved
- Cultures, e.g. small organizations, large organizations, non profits
- Behavior, e.g. left tasks/groups/classes just as they got challenging, stayed put rather than take a risk, looking for next challenge
- Lack of an element, e.g. lack of leadership (always behind-the-scenes), lack of outside activities (always only academic)

See if you have any <strong>"Interrupted Dreams"</strong>, e.g. things you put on hold because of being consumed by academics or sports. Maybe you just never got around to doing it. Examples might be:
- Early interest in music
- Competition between writing and sports, where sports won

Do you have any <strong>"Driving Motivators"</strong> that are rooted in the past that not longer serve you, e.g.

- Susan: worked three times harder than anyone (job, marriage, mother): driven by getting pregnant at 17 & given up college scholarship: Driving Motivator - vowed to beat the odds of not going to college. But she no longer had to prove herself, she had done that long ago.
- Tom: give you shirt off his back, gave away his ideas, help people who weren’t ready to change: Driving Motivator – guilt because his family always had everything. He could now realize he did not have to take the responsibility for his family's success.
- Mason: everything was because “he should do it” - the message he received from his family all the time. Did he still have to do things because he felt he had to please his family or could he start doing things that meant something to him.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Try these Prompts</strong></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
These are some things to consider
<ul>
</ul>
- <strong>Don't Want to Do</strong>: If you can't think of anything you want to do, how about thinking of some things you know you don't want to do. Most people can come up with things they don't want to do more easily than they can identify what they want to do.

Part of Don's Autobiography was working for four summers with his father as an apprentice plumber and electrician. He also worked on a crew paving country roads one summer. During those 5 years he would work on farms from time to time. He knew he was not good at practical activities and should not pursue a trade. Instead he needed to do some more intellectual.
<ul>
</ul>
- <strong>Born to Do</strong>: Do you feel compelled to do something because of family traditions or patterns? 

Harry was raised in a family where both parents were social workers. His father was a Professor of Social Work. He called his mother an idealist who often did things for others. In his definition of what he wanted to do when he was thirty one of the things he said was "I want to do something where I am helping others because it makes me feel positive." He also often organized social outings for others, e.g. ski trips.
<ul>
</ul>
- <strong>Others said you should do</strong>: Is there a common theme of what others have said you should be doing with your life, e.g. you have the mind of a lawyer, you should use you musical talents, all of the family has gone into medicine? 

Don was always expected to be the responsible person, the one upon whom the group could depend. Especially in high school he was expected to be the "adult". His mother was a teacher and as the principal said one time "we expect more from you Don". That expectation stayed with him in college.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Write your Autobiography Insights</strong></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
You can write your insights as either a separate document as Don and Casey did. 
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography Insights</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Don-AutobiographyInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Don's Autobiography Insights</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
Or you can incorporate your Insights into your Autobiography by placing them at the end of the document.
<ul>
</ul>


	<li><h2><strong>2) Document your Major Transitions and Provide Insights</strong></h2></li>
You have to decide what qualifies as a major enough Transition to make it in this document. When I think of a major transition I look at the difference between the beginning state (the “from”) and the ending state (the “to”). I see it as major when there is a lot of difference in how you live your life, e.g.

- Moving Homes (with your parents): once, twice, more 
- From home in high end town to college in old inner city 
- Changing Schools: public elementary to private middle & high school
- Changing High School to College: small to large, public to private, private to public
- Changing Sports Teams: While in high school, high school to college, while in college
- Parents getting Divorced
- New Blended Family
- Popular to Unpopular
- Normal student to Leader
- Service worker to internship
- Worker to manager
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Transitions & Major Transitions documents</strong></h3>
Here is a simple way to create a Transitions document. Make a copy of your Autobiography and name it XYZ-Transitions.doc. Now go through the document highlighting all of the items in red you feel have been a transition for you. If you believe there have been other Transitions you have not captured with this approach write them at the end of the document.

To create a Major Transitions document you take the items you believe to be major and make them Bold. If you now print out a copy of the document you will have your Transitions document, which is your entire Autobiography, with some items in red and others in Bold red. This should provide you with a lot of insights into your life. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Transitions.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Transitions & Insights</a> to see an example of that approach.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Transition Insights</strong></h3>
You could have made a lot of transitions in your life already, as laid out earlier. Each one of those transitions could provide some insights that could contribute to one of your four MyRightCareer Insights files:

- <strong>Moving Homes (with your parents):</strong> Maybe you have moved several times in your life, what did you learn from that. Maybe you only moved once before going to college, but that was either great or terrible.
- <strong>From home in high end town to college in old inner city:</strong> Unfortunately a lot of the older, very good schools, are "on the wrong side of the tracks". This may be the first time you have not lived in an upscale community.
- <strong>Changing Schools:</strong> Maybe you went from a large public elementary school to a small private middle school. Or from a small private middle school to a large public high school.
- <strong>Changing Schools:</strong> Maybe you went from a large public high school to a huge public college. Or from a small private high school to a private college that is still dramatically larger than your high school.
- <strong>Changing Sports Teams:</strong> Maybe you went from a friendly local soccer team to a competitive college prep team with kids from all over the area.
- <strong>Changing Sports Teams:</strong> Maybe you went from being a star on your club soccer team to being on the bench on your college soccer team.
- <strong>Parents getting Divorced:</strong> Maybe your parents got divorced and your life changed dramatically.
- <strong>Blended Family:</strong> Maybe your divorced mother got remarried and you now have a half sister and half brother around your age.
- <strong>Popular to Unpopular:</strong> Maybe you suddenly were no longer part of the "In" group. 
- <strong>Normal student to Leader:</strong> Maybe you became the President of your class and people treated you differently.
<ul>
</ul>
You can write your insights as either a separate document as Don did. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Don-TransitionsInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Don's Transitions Insights</a> to see how he formatted his Transition insights. What he did was make each of his major Transitions a bullet in the Autobiography outline and then put a insight comment indented below the Major Transition. 
<ul>
</ul>
Or you can incorporate your Insights into your Transitions document by placing them at the end of the document as Casey did. She wrote three paragraphs.

<em>I realized the major academic transitions have been the hardest for me. I went to an all girls middle school where I had to make new friends and I was only around girls was hard for me to adapt too. Similarity, when I went to my large public high school, I had to transition back to being in a co-ed environment that wasn’t as creative or free as my small private all girls’ middle school. I was lucky to find a great group of girls who I love with all my heart. 

Both transitions helped me prepare for the biggest one yet, moving all the way to the east coast for college where I only see my family and home friends every few months. It is very different on the east coast and I learned that you have to be outgoing if you want to make friends and meet people. 

While these transitions have been difficult, they have helped me attain traits which I am most proud of today (my outgoing personality, optimistic attitude, being able to adapt to a new environment). </em>
<ul>
</ul>


	<li><h2><strong>3) Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h2></li>
If you remember from the previous exercise, Begin at the End, there are four MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine" and one for "Right Opportunity". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.

You have already gained insights from your Autobiography exercise and your Transitions exercise. Below are some Prompts that can generate some more insights around your Autobiography. They should get you thinking about insights from a different angle:
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Casey Examples</strong></h3>
These four documents are examples of the insights Casey added based on the Autobiography exercise. She was able to add a lot of insights by using the material she gained from:

- Autobiography itself
- Autobiography Insights document
- Transitions Insights
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the links below to see Casey's examples - showing her insights from both the Begin at the End and Autobiography exercises:
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-MyRC-RightOpportunity-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Opportunity" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h3>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- Be Your Best: From looking at your Autobiography you should have been able to identify some natural strengths and indications of your natural personality. Have you ever dedicated yourself to one activity, e.g. soccer or theater, and become really good at it. Do people tell you that you are outgoing?
- Meaning & Passion: You most likely have had some passions in your life as of now. Do you love theater, sports? Are you involved in any political activities. It doesn't mean those are the ones you will have going forward, but it is important to document them.
- Fuel your Economic Engine: Can you tell if your current economic standard of living is higher or lower than the one you probably will be able to afford when you are age 30? If your parents live in an expensive home and work in high paying jobs it is doubtful you will be able to do that by age 30. But is that your expectation? Have you worked to pay your expenses or have your parents always paid all your expenses?
- Right Opportunities: Maybe you have always wanted to be a jet pilot, Don did. Maybe when you were younger you wanted to be a coach. Even if you don't want to have those as a career now, write them down because they provide some insights into your thinking at that time. Do you have multiple ideas now that you have looked back over your life? They don't have to be realistic or even things that will survive further analysis. Write them down because they provide insights into your thought process.
<ul>
</ul>


	<li><h2><strong>4) Discuss your Results with Your Facilitator</strong></h2></li>
Now it is time again to discuss your results with your Facilitator. You may have been communicating with them along the way, e.g. you might have shared a draft of your Autobiography. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Discuss Content Issues</strong></h3>
These first items are content oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Autobiography Insights:</strong> This is a key document to discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Autobiography:</strong> This is a backup to the Insights. Remember it was not really written to be read so you will probably have to add some context for them.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Major Transitions Insights:</strong> Another key document to discuss</li>
<li><strong>Major Transitions:</strong> This is a backup and probably should be shown.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights Documents:</strong> This is the most important set of documents you have to discuss. You should have taken all of your findings in this exercise and placed them in the right of the four documents. There are four of these - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine and Right Opportunities. This is the first time you will have added insights to an existing document so it is important to see how your knowledge is growing.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Discuss Process Issues</strong></h3>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done two exercises. You and your Facilitator may want to revise your schedule.</li>

	<li><strong>Facilitator Review Process:</strong> You have just finished your 2nd review, maybe the two of you want to do it differently in the future, or you now have a process that works for both of you.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these two exercises.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
The most important thing for you to discuss are the four MyRightCareer Insights documents. They will form the foundation for the identification of your Right Opportunity in the Capstone Project.
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>


<h2><strong>5) Feedback</strong></h2>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=940">Feedback</a> to access the Feedback page so you can take a survey and provide your feedback on the Autobiography Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
As we said before I am making changes to the MyRightCareer Program and Web site in almost real time so your timely feedback is very important. Students coming after you will benefit from it.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>

In the previous exercise, Begin at the End, you should have picked up some insights about your Right Career from visualizing your life at Age 30. This exercise, looking back over your life and your ancestors lives, gives you a different perspective. These two views of your life should give you some insights into what you can “Be Best At - your natural strengths & personality”, what has “Meaning & Passion” for you, what influences your "Economic Engine" and maybe some ideas of what you might find interesting (or found in the past) as your Right Career.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should watch the Welcome to Autobiography video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as you do this exercise:
<h4><strong>Autobiography</strong></h4>
Make sure they don't get carried away and write a true Autobiography. It should just be an outline.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Autobiography.pdf" target="_blank"> Casey's Autobiography</a>
<h4><strong>Transitions</strong></h4>
At their age they should have made a lot of transitions because every thing they do is new, e.g. going from one elementary school to middle school, going from for fun soccer to serious soccer. There are a lot of insights that can come from these transitions.

<h4><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents</strong></h4>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. They should have taken all of their findings in this exercise and placed them in the appropriate document - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. They will be accumulating their insights about each circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably quite a few weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached. A lot of time all they have to do is copy the insights from documents they have already created during the exercise, e.g. there is an insights document for their Age 30 Vision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Your assignment involves these steps: 1) Visualize Yourself at Age 30, 2) Work Backward, 3) Create a Structural Tension document, 4) document your MyRightCareer Insights, 5) Provide feedback, 6) Discuss your completed exercise with your Facilitator and 7) Become an Example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. In total they will probably take you about 4 hours.

Note: If you are an experienced adult, instead of a student, visit the "Experienced Adult" page before beginning this exercise.

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BeginAtEnd_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Begin at the End Checklist</a> and you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the Begin at the End Exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.

There are two approaches you can take to complete exercises: Short Instructions or Full Instructions. You can also use a hybrid approach in at least two different ways: 1) Use the Short Instructions for one Step and then switch to the Full Instructions on another Step if you need more help or 2) Use the Short Instructions on a Step until you need more help on that Step and then go directly to the Full Instructions on that Step for more instructions.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end-full-instructions/short-instructions/">Short Instructions Approach</a></strong></h1>
If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically reading a couple of sentences of instructions and using examples to do your work.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end-full-instructions/step0/">Full Instructions</a></strong></h1>
If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the approximately 6 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the Right Career Course. The objective is to provide an overview of the Right Career concept.

<img src="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/venn-e1289370206966.jpg" align="left" >
•	Create meaning and passion

•	Be your best

•	Fuel your “economic engine”
.
.
.
.
.
The course has five modules. The core of the course are the 3 modules describing the three overlapping circles in the Right Career diagram above.

To access each of the modules click on the paragraph headings below. This will launch Windows Media Player and a presentation by Don will begin on that topic. When the presentation finishes you can close Windows Media Player and then the Tab and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-Course-1-Intro.wmv" target="_blank">Introduction</a></h4> This module provides an introduction to the Right Career concept and the Whole Person concept. It is about 4 minutes long.</li> 
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-Course-2-BeBest.wmv" target="_blank">Be Your Best</a></h4> This module explains how leveraging your natural strengths & personality allows you to Be Your Best. It is about 8 minutes long.</li> 
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-Course-3-Meaning.wmv" target="_blank">Meaning & Passion</a></h4> This module provides more detail on the Meaning & Passion circle and conclusions from the Success Built to Last research. It is about 6 minutes long.</li> 
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-Course-4-EconEngine.wmv" target="_blank">Fuel Your Economic Engine</a></h4> This module explains the Economic Engine concept. It is about 8 minutes long</li> 
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-Course-5-Summary.wmv" target="_blank">Summary</a></h4> This module summaries the Right Career and Whole Person concepts. It also talks about their application over the life of your career, not just at the start. It is about 7 minutes long.</li> 
<ul>
</ul>
This is a self-paced course. You should begin the course with the Introduction module. After the Introduction module you should start taking the modules on the three overlapping circles in the Right Career diagram above. Each one stands alone so they could be taken at different times during the day or on different days. Obviously you should end by taking the Summary module. The total length of the Right Career course is a approximately 35 minutes. All of the modules are less than 10 minutes in length.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Begin at the End Concept</strong></h1>
So what is the Begin at the End approach? Robert Fritz discovered it when he studied great artists. He found they used this technique to visualize their end result of playing the piano in Carnegie hall and working backwards to their current reality of playing piano in the 4th grade. They then created structural tension between their current reality and a realistic first step. Great athletic coaches use this to visualize winning the league championship and working backwards to their current reality of having just finished a losing season. They then created structural tension between their current reality and a realistic first step. They realized it they did not make it to that first step they were not going to make it to their end result.

In both cases starting with their current reality (playing piano in the 4th grade or coming off of a losing season) seems so over whelming people are often stuck and can not make any progress. The secret to these successful people is their ability to Visualize the End Result and Work Backwards and then start with some small steps.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Instructions</strong></h1>

<h3><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-2-BeginAtEnd.wmv" target="_blank">Welcome to the Begin at the End Exercise</a></h3>
Click on the link above to see a 5 minute video where Don explains your Assignment via some examples.

Note: If you are using a Mac you will need to install Flip4Mac, the official Windows Media Player on the Mac, so you can play Windows Media files (.wma and .wmv) and view Windows Media content using a Web browser. You only need the Free player. Click Flip4Mac.

At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
There are two major sections to the these instructions. In the first section you will learn about the basic “Begin at the End” approach. This approach is applicable to a lot of aspects of your life besides your career. I have used it very successfully in business. It is used by many successful coaches and athletes.

In the second section you will go to a unique page for each step in the Assignment: 1) Visualize Yourself at Age 30, 2) Work Backward, 3) Create a Structural Tension document, 4) document your MyRightCareer Insights, 5) Provide feedback, 6) Discuss your completed exercise with your Facilitator and 7) Become an Example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. Steps 1 through 4 will probably take you about 4 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Resources to help you</strong></h1>
<strong>Examples</strong>:One of the best ways to do this exercise is to look at how others have done the exercise. There is an exercise from Edward in all of the Assignments and it is the most complete exercise. You do not have to have your exercise be as complete as his, but it is useful as an example. The other exercises are more representative of what a typical college student would do. The examples can be found on the Begin at the End Examples page in the Sub Navigation section on the right hand side of this page.

<strong>Templates</strong>: The examples also serve as templates. You can download them in their native format, mostly Word, and then use their structure, substituting your own information. They can be found on the Begin at the End Templates page in the Sub Navigation section on the right hand side of this page.

<strong>Video</strong>: For those of you who learn better by listening to a presentation, instead of reading instructions, you can watch the Welcome video again. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Visualization Concept</strong></h2>

You want to describe your situation at your 30th birthday. One way I suggest doing this is actually putting you at that 30th birthday party. Better yet make it a whole 30th Birthday weekend - you have the party on Saturday night and you have a bunch of your long term friends coming to visit you for the weekend. Who would those long term friends be that would come to spend the weekend. During that time what types of things would they be asking you and what types of things would you tell them about your life. What if you had not seen one of your long term friends in 5 years - how would you describe your life to him/her?

I am asking you to truly visualize yourself at age 30. If you are artistic you may want to draw some pictures of your 30th birthday party and other events surrounding your 30th birthday. If you are like me and can’t draw or paint, you may want to download some clip art. 

With all that art you could create a Vision Board. Edward's Dream Board below was created with O Dream Board. I am sure most of you can do a more artistic job than Edward did, but it does communicate most of what he has in his Word document. 
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-Age30_VisionBoard.jpg"target="_blank">Edward's Age 30 Vision Board</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's End Result in Words</a>
<ul>
</ul>
The O Dream Board is available for free at <a href="http://www.oprah.com/dreamboard/index.html" target="_blank">Oprah.com.</a> I am not endorsing their product, just providing them as an example.
<ul>
</ul>
Another method of creating a Vision Board is to cut out photo's and paste them on a big poster board, You can also write and draw on the poster board.
<ul>
</ul>
A great resource to help you do this is a friend who knows you well. This is an exercise that lends itself to brainstorming. The two of you can spend an hour talking about your vision of yourself at age 30. Together you will come up with something better than you will by yourself.
<ul>
</ul>
The "Visualize the End Result" portion of the assignment will probably take you from 1 to 2 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A) Visualize your Whole Person at Age 30</strong></h2>
This exercise allows you to accomplish something very important - paint a picture, using the "Whole Person" parameters, of your life at age 30. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Whole-Person.pdf" target="_blank">Whole Person</a> to see a chart depicting the Whole Person concept. It was explained in the Right Career Course you took in the Prerequisites Assignment (you did take that course didn't you?). You are more than just your Career, you have all of the other elements surrounding your Career. There are a lot more things to consider when choosing your Right Career than just the jobs you will have, e.g. where you want to live, your personal relationships and your family. For example what if when you are 30 and you are only willing to be living and working in California. Or you may only be willing to work somewhere that allows you to live in San Francisco and not commute more than 30 minutes. As you later go through the process of deciding on your Right Career these Whole Person parameters will be very important to understand. By fast forwarding to age 30 you can see if you have some Whole Person issues that will end up heavily influencing your career choices.

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Madison-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Madison's End Result</a> and you will see an example of the document you will end up creating.

Here are some standard variables you can start with, but customize the list for your unique situation.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Whole Person Elements</strong></h4>
At age 30 there will be more to your life than just your job (career). This exercise also allows you to complete the picture with other "Whole Person" parameters.

	<li><strong>Personal Items, e.g.:</strong> Personal Relationship (e.g., single, living with someone or married), Immediate Family (e.g. no kids, one kid or two kids), Extended Family (e.g., emotionally close to them, estranged from them, live close by), Friends (e.g. ones from high school &amp; college, new ones from work), Location (e.g. San Francisco, NYC, Europe, in a city, in the countryside), Residence (e.g. house, condo, apartment), Your Health (e.g. still playing soccer, better shape than now, better shape than other 30 year old's)</li>
	<li><strong>Work Related Items, e.g.:</strong> Type Organization (e.g. , Fortune 100, Early Stage Hi Tech, Non-Profit, Education), Social work environment (lots of young like minded people, serious top tier firm), Physical work environment (Google type, Wall Street type), Commute (out of home, less than 30 minutes, by train to city)</li>

You can also use the categories in <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/WholePerson-Examples-V3.pdf" target="_blank">Whole Person Examples</a> as a template. It provides sample sentences you could use to describe your situation at Age 30.
<h4><strong>Whole Person Examples</strong></h4>
Below are different examples of how people visualized themselves at Age 30 on some Whole Person parameters:

	<li><strong>Married:</strong> This person visualized themselves being married when they were age 30. They wanted to live together two years before getting married.</li>
	<li><strong>Married and Buying a House or Condo:</strong> This person visualized themselves buying a house by the time they are 30. They also visualized themselves being married by that time as well. But they are determined to own a house, or condo, by age 30 whether or not they are married.</li>
	<li><strong>Married and Having your 1st child:</strong> This person visualizes themselves having a family with their 1st child being born when they are are 30 and other children to follow soon after. They want to have been married for two years before starting the child bearing process to ensure they have a stable marriage.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What if you are out of College?</strong></h4>
Age 30 was chosen because it is far enough enough from the typical college student (e.g. Age 21 or Age 22) to allow them to remove themselves from their current situation. Age 30 is also a major milestone.

If you are already out of school than you want to use an age about 7 to 10 years in the future. Carolyn is 25 and she used age 35. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Elizabeth-EndResult-Age30.pdf"target="_blank">Elizabeth's End Result</a> to see how she visualizes herself at Age 35.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Write Your Age 30 Vision Document</strong></h3>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Template-EndResult-Age30.doc" target="_blank">End Result Word Template</a> you will get a Word file with a lot of headings you can use to create your own Age 30 End Result document. If you would like to use Casey's document as your template click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-EndResult-Age30.doc" target="_blank">Casey's End Result</a> and you will get a Word file of Casey's End Result description.

Even though Casey, Madison and Edward's examples all have a career element to them they still are mainly a definition of their Whole Person, so they are good examples for you to use.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>B) Optional Exercise - Visualize your Career at Age 30</strong></h2>
I know what you are thinking - "The purpose of the MyRightCareer Program is to help me identify my Right Career, so why am I being asked to visualize my career at age 30?" This is a totally optional part of this exercise. If you don't have any idea of what your career will be at age 30 then skip this part of the exercise.

Here are some reasons you may want to attempt to visualize a career at age 30: 1) You might already have some ideas and the MyRightCareer Program will allow you to validate if any or all of them are good ideas, 2) You just might want to try out a career idea to see how it feels when surrounded by all the other Whole Person parameters (e.g. When I am 30 I am a lawyer working in the White House, living in Georgetown, I am so busy I barely have time to date, but this is so exciting, etc), 3) By thinking a long way out in time it might help you think of some careers you would like to be doing at that time, 4) It might help you think of some careers, or things, you would <strong>NOT </strong>like to be doing at that time (e.g. I don't want to do what my Dad has been doing for the last 30 years or I don't want to be working in an office) or 5) You might just want to describe some parameters for your career like Harry does below.

<h4><strong>Career Dimensions</strong></H4>
A simple way to think of a career is it has two dimensions: Function and Industry.

	<li><strong>Function, e.g. Sales, Marketing, P/R, Finance</strong>

There is a definition for this dimension and it is called Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). There are 840 Occupations and they are in Major Groups (23), Minor Groups (97) and Broad Group (461). Click on <a href="http://www.onetonline.org/find/" target="_blank">O*NET Occupations</a> to access a Web site that will allow you to explore the vast range of occupations in a variety of ways, e.g. Job Family (groups of occupations based upon work performed, skills, education, training, and credentials), Career Clusters (occupations in the same field of work that require similar skills), Bright Outlook (occupations which are expected to grow rapidly in the next several years, will have large numbers of job openings, or are new and emerging occupations). </li>

	<li><strong>Industry, e.g. Manufacturing, Retail, Health Care, Finance, Art/Entertainment</strong>

There is a definition for this dimension and it is called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Every company has a NAICS. Click on <a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012" target="_blank">2012 NAICS</a> and you will see a list of the 20 major industry groups. You can click on any of those major industry groups and you will then see the sub industries (maybe 30 more). </li>

While almost every Occupation, or function, exists in every Industry they can be quite different depending on the Industry. For example sales in high tech is different than sales in consumer goods. Sales tends to require a lot of knowledge of the industry and customer. There are roles like Finance have more elements in common across the different industries.

During the remainder of the MyRightCareer Program you will have opportunities to revisit the issue of occupations and industries.

To visualize your career it might be sufficient to only choose one of the two dimensions, e.g.

	<li><strong>Function</strong> - I see myself working in marketing.</li>

	<li><strong>Industry</strong> - I see myself working in the fashion industry.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Career Visualization Examples</strong></H4>
Below are different examples of how people visualized their careers:

	<li><strong>Multiple Majors:</strong> In some ways Edward has not really thought about a career because he has still not settled on a major. This is not an unusual problem for students, especially in today's economic climate. Edward has three different possible strategies for his major: Engineering (finishing his engineering degree and having that be his terminal major), Business (finishing his engineering degree and then immediately go into an MBA Program) and Legal (finishing his engineering degree and then immediately go to Law school). If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's End Result</a> you will get a pdf file of Edward vision of himself at age 30. It is not hard for Edward to visualize having a technical career given he is about to enter his senior year in engineering school and will soon graduate as an engineer. Edward is using the MyRightCareer Program to decide which of the majors is right for him.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Multiple Career Ideas</strong>: Carolyn is three years out college and has just turned 25. She see herself at Age 35 in one of three careers: Chief Marketing Officer in a company, Lawyer/Entrepreneur and something in the Health field. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Elizabeth-Working_Backwards.pdf"target="_blank">Elizabeth's Work Backwards</a> to see how she describes her three career possibilities.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Very General</strong>: Harry did not have a specific career in mind. Rather he has some parameters, he wanted something that: I enjoy, I am good at, I have passion for, I am helping others (makes me feel positive), I am in charge of my own destiny (no one employer can fire me), I have flexibility to take time off, I have flexibility to work in various locations, and I can work part-time if needed. Harry is going to use the MyRightCareer Program to identify a career that will meet those parameters.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Try out a Career Idea:</strong> Madison thinks she wants to have her own business when she is 30. That is a very general idea of a career and can have many different variations. Madison is using the MyRightCareer Program to validate if owning her own business is the right career for her.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>A Best Guess:</strong> Casey has an idea of what she wants to do as a career. She is not sure that it is exactly her Right Career and is going to use the MyRightCareer Program to validate that choice. If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-EndResult-Age30.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's End Result</a> you will get a pdf file showing Casey's description of her life at Age 30. While she is not so sure about her career choice, she does have some pretty concrete ideas about several Whole Person parameters, e.g. location and personal relationships. Casey is using the MyRightCareer Program to validate her Best Guess and if that turns out to not be true to iterate to another Best Guess.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
Remember if you don't have an idea of what career you want then just skip this part of the exercise. The most important part of this exercise is painting a picture of your Whole Person, without your career, at age 30. It will help frame your career decision later in the Program.
<ul>
</ul>

<h2><strong>C) Add your Age 30 Vision Insights</strong></h2>
At the end of Casey, Madison and Edward's Age 30 Vision documents you will see a section titled "Insights". In that section they provide the insights they gained by doing this exercise. For example Edward's Insights are:

<em>It was fun to think about the other elements of my life at that time. Some I have thought about, e.g. location (I have wanted to live in California, which means LA to me, for a long time), commute (I worked two summers in big cities and had to commute) and fun (with a salary I know I will be able to do a lot of fun things). But a lot of the others (e.g. personal relationship, kids, friends) I had not given much thought.</em>

<em>This has been helpful because I was forced to put down on paper my choice of a major – which of the 3 paths do I want to take. I thought I had made that choice when I was a sophomore. It has been rolling around in my head for the last year, but I have not really been focusing on it. This let me remove myself from my immediate decision and think about what I want my work life to be when I am 30. </em>

You now need to add your own Insights at the end of your Age 30 vision document.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 2 - Work Backwards-End</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end/step-2/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A) Write your Work Backwards Document</strong></h2>
Now pick one category, e.g. Financial, Personal Relationship, Family, Career. With that one category you will work backwards from your Ultimate End Result (age 30) to your Intermediate End Result #3 (age 27) to your Intermediate End Result #2 (age 24) to your Intermediate End Result #1 (age 22). You can pick any ages for your Intermediate End Results that make sense for your life. The above are just to give you a starting point. The "Work Backwards" portion of the assignment will probably take you about 1/2 to 1 hour.
<h4><strong>Whole Person Examples</strong></h4>
Below are some examples that use Whole Person parameters to help you write your own document.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Married-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank">Married at Age 30</a> This person visualized themselves being married when they were age 30. They wanted to live together two years before getting married.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/House-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank">Married &amp; Buy a House at Age 30</a> This person visualized themselves buying a house by the time they are 30. They also visualized themselves being married by that time as well. But they are determined to own a house, or condo, by age 30 whether or not they are married. This example contains a financial analysis that works backwards from the house they visualize buying at Age 30 to what they must start doing at Age 23.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Child-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank">Married &amp; 1st Child at Age 30</a> This person visualizes themselves having a family with their 1st child being born when they are are 30 and other children to follow soon after. They want to have been married for two years before starting the child bearing process to ensure they have a stable marriage.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Career Examples</strong></h4>
If you chose a career as an end result and want to work backwards from that end point below are some examples that will help you. Casy's example is also a template you can find on the Template page.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank"> Casey's Work Backwards</a> is a pdf file of how Casey worked backwards from her age 30 career idea to age 22, her graduation from college.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Madison-WorkBackwards.pdf"target="_blank">Madison's Work Backwards</a> is a pdf file of how Madison worked backwards.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Don-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Work Backwards</a> is a pdf file of how Edward worked backwards for each of his three possible careers. On the second page you will also see how he worked backwards on his personal relationship.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Elizabeth-Working_Backwards.pdf"target="_blank">Elizabeth's Work Backwards</a> is a pdf file of how Elizabeth worked backwards from age 35 to her current age (25). She also worked backwards on her Personal Life. Her document is well done  and you could user her format for yours if you have multiple career ideas.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Create your own Work Backwards document</strong></h4>
Now you need to create your own Work Backwards document.
<h2><strong>B) Add your Work Backwards Insights</strong></h2>
The “Work Backwards Insights” portion of the assignment will probably take you about 1/2 to 1 hour.
<h4><strong>Whole Person Examples</strong></h4>
At the end of the Getting Married, Buying a House or Condo and Having a Baby Work Backwards documents you will see a section titled "Insights". In that section you will find the insights gained by doing this exercise.
<ul>
	<li>For example the "Married &amp; Having our 1st Child" example Insights are:
<em>I have placed a lot of constraints on myself: wanting to be married for 2 years before having a baby, wanting to live together for 1 year before getting married and wanting to date seriously for 1 year before living together. This backs everything up 4 years. Then you have to add 1 year to actually have a baby and it is 5 years from the time we start dating seriously. What if it takes another year to have our 1st child, it is now 6 years. This only gives me two years to meet the right person.
</em></li>
	<li>Another example are the Insights from "Married &amp; Buying a House":
<em>I have to do everything as if I am not going to be married. Or as if my significant other is not going to contribute. I have to start saving when I am 23 if I want to have $50K when I am 30 years old. If my significant other has been saving then we will have more than $50K. I also have to significantly increase my income from age 22 to age 30 – it doubles from $40K to $80K. If my salary doesn’t increase that fast I will end up saving less than $50K.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Career Examples</strong></h4>
At the end of Casey, Madison and Edward's Work Backwards documents you will see a section titled "Insights". In that section they provide the insights they gained by doing this exercise.
<ul>
	<li>For example Casey's Insights are:<em>Working backwards was not an easy concept for me. It was easy to define where I wanted to be at age 30, even though I am not sure that is really my Right Career it is still a fun thing to think about. Then I had to think what type of person would that company want to hire as their Director of Marketing &amp; PR. What would I have to have done before I got that job to be a good candidate? I decided they would either want someone who was already a Director, but in another small company in the same area, or they would want someone from a large well known company. I also decided they would want someone who had managed people. So I gave myself that resume. Then I had to decide how would I have gotten to be a manager in a large well known company? I assumed I would have to have worked my way up from the bottom by being very successful so I joined them out of college. It was fun and a learning experience to build up my resume this way.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Add your own Insights</strong></h4>
Now you need to add your own Insights to your Work Backwards document.

Working backwards has the benefit of introducing reality to your End Result. If your professional End Result is to be the VP of Marketing for Facebook by age 30 working backwards will probably show you that is quite a challenge. If your personal End Result is having 3 kids by the time you are 30 it will show you to not wait until you are 27 to get married.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 3 - Create Structural Tension-End</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end/step-3/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 22:07:56 +0000</pubDate>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=1352</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now use the Structural Tension idea and create the objectives (try to keep it around 5 objectives) that would get you from your Current Reality to your Intermediate End Result #1. This portion of the assignment will probably take you about 1/2 hour.
<h3><strong>A) Write your Structural Tension Document</strong></h3>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-StructuralTension.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Structural Tension</a> you will get a pdf file of how Casey created a Structural Tension diagram between her Current Reality (summer between her Sophomore &amp; Junior year) and her Intermediate End Result #1 (age 22 = graduation from college). It shows her objectives for those two years.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Madison-StructuralTension.pdf"target="_blank">Madison's Structural Tension</a> you will get a pdf file of how Madison created a Structural Tension diagram.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Don-StructuralTension.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Structural Tension</a> you will get a pdf file of how Edward created Structural Tension diagram between his Current Reality (start of his senior year) and his Intermediate End Result #1 (end of his senior year). Because of the nature of his 3 potential career paths he had to make his Intermediate End Result #1 be closer in than suggested.
<h3><strong>B) Add your Structural Tension Insights</strong></h3>
At the end of Casey, Madison and Edward's Structural Tension documents you will see a section titled "Insights". In that section they provide the insights they gained by doing this exercise. For example Casey's Insights are:

<em>Doing this Structural Tension exercise sure brought me back to reality. It made me focus on the fact that I am not going to be a Director unless I reach my first objective “I am an intern at either one of the top clothing design companies or top marketing professionals at one of the top clothing companies.”</em>

<em>When I came up with the list of five things I need to accomplish in the next two years it made me realize I have a lot of hard work in front of me. But I can now see it can lead to something great. I actually don’t know if I really want to pursue that exact path but I think those 5 objectives are the right ones for me because I am going to do something in that general area.</em>

Madison had these insights:

<em>By focusing on these small steps, it will make the process of attaining my first intermediate end result a lot more manageable. I know now that I must work hard to attain these goals, in order to ultimately achieve my dream.</em>

Edward also has insights at the end of his Structural Tension document. Rather than showing them in total here is a summary:

<em>If I took either the Business or Legal path I had to make that decision by January of my senior year, i.e in only 6 months. This was because they both required me to go to graduate school and I would need to apply to either an MBA Program or a Law school by then. Even before than I need to be doing preparation work on those two paths. I was clearly behind in making my career decision.</em>

Now you need to add your own Insights to your Structural Tension document.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
There are five MyRightCareer Insights files, one for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram: "Be Your Best", "Meaning & Passion", "Fuel Your Economic Engine" and "Right Career". There is another for the Whole Person. Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. It is better to write down as many insights as you can, even if you don't think they are exactly relevant. It is easy to forget things in a long program. 
<ul>
</ul>
These files are the most important files you are creating. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Create your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Templates for these files can be found on the Begin at the End Templates page. You can use these templates to create your own files and begin filling out your insights. You are only adding insights for the Begin at the End exercise. One of the simplest ways of doing this is to copy/paste from the files you created in this exercise. Error on the side of including too much information in the MyRightCareer Insights files. It will be easier to delete this information later than to go back to this exercise and try to recreate it when you are working on your Capstone Project.
<ul>
</ul>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Keep these five files somewhere you will not lose them. You are going to adding to them as part of each exercise.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser/Facilitator. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared you Age 30 Vision. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A) Discuss Content Issues</strong></h3>
These first items are content oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Age 30 Vision Document:</strong> (If you are currently 25 then your Age 30 Vision will probably be an Age 35 Vision)</li>

	<li><strong>Work Backwards: Age 22 Intermediate End Result #1:</strong> (This is assuming you are currently an undergrad and you will graduate at age 22).</li>

	<li><strong>Structural Tension: Age Now vs. Age 22 Structural Tension Document:</strong> What are you going to focus on in the next few months that will move you closer to where you want to be upon graduation.</li>
 
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights Documents:</strong> This is the most important set of documents you have to discuss. They should have taken all of their findings in this exercise and placed them in the appropriate document - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. They will form the foundation for the identification of your Right Opportunity in the Capstone Project.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B) Discuss Process Issues</strong></h3>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You now have an idea of how long it took to do one Assignment vs. the estimated time. You and your Adviser may want to revise your schedule.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> You have just finished your 1st review, maybe the two of you want to do it differently in the future.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing this first Assignment.</li>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Exercise Strategy</strong></h2>
One of the purposes of the Alpha Program is to collect a group of examples to assist students who will use the MyRightCareer Program in the future. As you are witnessing the Program relies heavily on examples as the way to communicate how to do an exercise.

The long term goal is to have comprehensive set of exercises:

- All of the target markets: Undergraduate Students (freshman, sophomores, juniors and seniors), Graduate Students and Just Graduated
- Gender Mix: maybe 60% female and 40% male, which is the typical college campus mix
- Degree Discipline Mix: Career Oriented (e.g. Engineering and Business) and Academic Oriented (e.g. Liberal Arts and Sciences). Historically college graduates' disciplines are about 60% career oriented and 40% academic oriented. I plan to have the example mix probably 60% academic oriented because they are more likely to want to identify a Career than students who have already chosen a Career oriented discipline.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>1) Pick a Stage Name</strong></h2>
Your exercise will not be put on the MyRightCareer Web site using your real name. You should pick a name you would like us to use. Maybe it is one you would use if you decided to be an actor, singer, writer, etc.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>2) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h2>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don@My-Right-Career.com: Age 30 End Result (your Vision), Work Backwards, Structural Tension and Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h2>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4) Don will load your Example on the Examples page</strong></h3>
At the minimum your example will appear on the examples page, "Woody - Just Graduated". Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Begin at the End</strong>: This is a chance to think beyond doing homework and going to class. A chance to think about a new world - the world beyond 17 years in school. It is a chance to fast forward to Age 30 and skip the rest of your 20's. Don't worry about how you got there. Bring in all the "Whole Person" parameters that are important to you. See your self at your 30th birthday party.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Work Backwards</strong> This is a chance to do a little reality test of your Age 30 Vision. Work backwards to Age 22 and you will have seen what milestones you need to meet to reach your Age 30 Vision.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>How will it really unfold?</strong> In reality things will unfold for you in ways that different than you put down on paper in this exercise. You will take your first step and either reach your Intermediate End Result #1 or not. You will certainly reach age 22. At Intermediate End Result #1 you will then decide the right next step.  
<ul>
</ul>
You can repeat this process at that time. You may not have the same Vision of your life at Age 30. You can work backwards once again from your new Age 30 Vision. But at some point opportunities may present themselves, or you will create them, that you never could have imagined. You will then make a decision if you should take advantage of those opportunities and your path will take a course that is very hard to predict right now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Autobiography Approach</strong></h1>
In your last assignment, Begin at the End, you visualized your life at Age 30. In this assignment you are looking back at your life to see if you can gain any further insights.

You will be doing this by documenting your life in a short Autobiography, in outline format. You will then look at all the Transitions you have made in your life. Using both of these you will look at the insights you can draw.
<ul>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<h3><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-2-Autobiography.wmv" target="_blank">Welcome to the Autobiography Exercise</a></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to see a video where Don describes the Autobiography  concept and explains your Exercise via some examples.

At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Write your autobiography & provide insights, 2) Document your transitions & provide insights, 3) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 4) Provide feedback, 5) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator and 6) Become an example.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is another exercise where you can use a friend to help you. It is best to use a friend who has know you for a long time, e.g. some one you've known since elementary or middle school. After you create your Autobiography sit down and discuss the elements with your friend. I can almost guarantee they will remember important items you left out and give you some interesting insights into items you have included.
<ul>
</ul>
While you are going to use the outline format to write your Autobiography the tips in the Howcast video below apply equally to that form of an Autobiography. The steps they recommend can be used for your bullet point Autobiography as well as a prose Autobiography.

<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNWtdMiuGnQ" target="_blank">Autobiography Tips</a></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
Complement your written Autobiography outline with a robust Facebook Timeline. Or just include photos in your Word file. You will find looking at photos of yourself growing up will help you write the Autobiography outline.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Autobiography Structure</strong></h1>
Here are some elements I would like you to use, but you are free to do this anyway you find easiest. Click on: 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Madison-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank"> Madison's Autobiography</a></li> 
<ul>
</ul>
to see a couple of examples that follow the recommended structure.

- <strong>Use an Outline format</strong>. Generally you don't need to use more than one line to describe each item, e.g. "Father quit Caterpillar and bought Varna Heating & Electric"; Merging our 13 kids with Lacon's 27 kids to make our 7th grade; Winning State Baseball Championship; Being in the Junior Play; Mr. Waxler said I should be an engineer so I went to engineering school. 

You are not writing this so someone else can read it. You know there is a story behind each of those one line statements. When you get famous you can use this as the outline for your Autobiography and then you (or your ghost writer) can write the prose that will let the rest of us understand your life. With Word you can have as many levels of indentation as you want if that helps communicate meaning.

- <strong>Have a separate page for each element of your Life Framework.</strong>  Casey's has a page for Ancestors, a page for Elementary through High School and a page for College. This lets you work on them separately – adding, deleting and changing material.

- <strong>Keep your Personal and Professional elements separate.</strong> For example in Edward's he has a Personal - College and a Professional - College. You could just put everything in Personal but it will help you later identifying your Right Career by having a Professional category. Examples of items that are in Edward's "Professional - College" are: Summer Job at Detroit Edison, Founding College Newspaper and Managing construction of Fraternity Homecoming Display.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Autobiography Approach</strong></h1>

Here is a tops down approach for writing your autobiography:

- <strong>High Level</strong> First, start with a high level version. Don’t try to put down detail until you get the overall structure in place. Now you have an outline and can fill in details. This is the way writing coaches suggest a book be written.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Family:  Parents & Siblings for sure
Maybe Grandparents or Uncles/Aunts, or Cousins if they influenced you</li>

	<li>Elementary School, Middle School (6th, 7th & 8th), High School (9th, 10th, 11th & 12th)</li>
 
	<li>College:  Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior</li>
<ul>
</ul>
- <strong>Put in some Detail</strong> Second, put in some detail so you have the start of your autobiography, e.g. on the professional side you want some detail below high school and college, while on the personal side you may want to have some level of personal detail on all of them. 

- <strong>Drill Down</strong> Third, pick a few areas and drill down in them. You will gain insights just by what areas you choose to dive down into (they show your interests). This is not about writing down everything that has happened in your life.

- <strong>Summary</strong>: You probably don’t want to have the same level of detail for every area. In the past one mistake I have seen people make is just starting to write and running out of steam about half way through. They ended up with way too much detail on the early parts of their life. One person did an elaborate history of their very large family. In retrospect they realized it was not going to be valuable but they found writing the history very interesting.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Insights Approaches</strong></h1>
Here are are different ways to help you gain some insights into your autobiography.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Look for Themes</strong></h3>
Below are some different ways of gaining insights from your autobiography taken from the book "What Now" by Laura Fortgang:

	<li><strong>"Golden Threads" </strong>: Take a look at any "Golden Threads" that may run through your life, e.g.
- Interests, e.g. environment, politics, technology
- Kinds of roles, e.g. leader, follower, avoid getting involved
- Cultures, e.g. small organizations, large organizations, non profits
- Behavior, e.g. left tasks/groups/classes just as they got challenging, stayed put rather than take a risk, looking for next challenge
- Lack of an element, e.g. lack of leadership (always behind-the-scenes), lack of outside activities (always only academic)</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>"Interrupted Dreams"</strong>: See if you have any "Interrupted Dreams", e.g. things you put on hold because of being consumed by academics or sports. Maybe you just never got around to doing it. Examples might be:
- Early interest in music
- Competition between writing and sports, where sports won, but you still have the passion for writing.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>"Driving Motivators"</strong>: Do you have any "Driving Motivators" that are rooted in the past that not longer serve you, e.g.

- Susan: worked three times harder than anyone (job, marriage, mother): driven by getting pregnant at 17 & given up college scholarship: Driving Motivator - vowed to beat the odds of not going to college. But she no longer had to prove herself, she had done that long ago.
- Tom: give you shirt off his back, gave away his ideas, help people who weren’t ready to change: Driving Motivator – guilt because his family always had everything. He could now realize he did not have to take the responsibility for his family's success.
- Mason: everything was because “he should do it” - the message he received from his family all the time. Did he still have to do things because he felt he had to please his family or could he start doing things that meant something to him.</li>

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Try these Prompts</strong></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Don't Want to Do</strong>: If you can't think of anything you want to do, how about thinking of some things you know you don't want to do. Most people can come up with things they don't want to do more easily than they can identify what they want to do.

Part of Edward's Autobiography was working for four summers with his father as an apprentice plumber and electrician. He also worked on a crew paving country roads one summer. During those 5 years he would work on farms from time to time. He knew he was not good at practical activities and should not pursue a trade. Instead he needed to do some more intellectual.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Born to Do</strong>: Do you feel compelled to do something because of family traditions or patterns? 

Harry was raised in a family where both parents were social workers. His father was a Professor of Social Work. He called his mother an idealist who often did things for others. In his definition of what he wanted to do when he was thirty one of the things he said was "I want to do something where I am helping others because it makes me feel positive." He also often organized social outings for others, e.g. ski trips.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Others said you should do</strong>: Is there a common theme of what others have said you should be doing with your life, e.g. you have the mind of a lawyer, you should use you musical talents, all of the family has gone into medicine? 

Edward was always expected to be the responsible person, the one upon whom the group could depend. Especially in high school he was expected to be the "adult". His mother was a teacher and as the principal said one time "we expect more from you Edward". That expectation stayed with him in college.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Write your Autobiography Insights</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
You can write your insights as either a separate document as Edward and Casey did. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography Insights</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Autobiography</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
Or you can incorporate your Insights into your Autobiography by providing the insights as you are writing about each stage of your life as Madison did:

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Madison-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank"> Madison's Autobiography</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
Or you can incorporate your Insights into your Autobiography by placing them at the end of the document.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
You have to decide what qualifies as a major enough Transition to make it in this document. When I think of a major transition I look at the difference between the beginning state (the “from”) and the ending state (the “to”). I see it as major when there is a lot of difference in how you live your life, e.g.

- Moving Homes (with your parents): once, twice, more 
- From home in high end town to college in old inner city 
- Changing Schools: public elementary to private middle & high school
- Changing High School to College: small to large, public to private, private to public
- Changing Sports Teams: While in high school, high school to college, while in college
- Parents getting Divorced
- New Blended Family
- Popular to Unpopular
- Normal student to Leader
- Service worker to internship
- Worker to manager
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A) Transitions & Major Transitions documents</strong></h3>
Here is a simple way to create a Transitions document. Make a copy of your Autobiography and name it XYZ-Transitions.doc. Now go through the document highlighting all of the items in red you feel have been a transition for you. If you believe there have been other Transitions you have not captured with this approach write them at the end of the document.

To create a Major Transitions document you take the items you believe to be major and make them Bold. If you now print out a copy of the document you will have your Transitions document, which is your entire Autobiography, with some items in red and others in Bold red. This should provide you with a lot of insights into your life. 
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Transitions.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Transitions & Insights</a> to see an example of that approach.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B) Transition Insights</strong></h3>
You could have made a lot of transitions in your life already, as laid out earlier. Each one of those transitions could provide some insights that could contribute to one of your four MyRightCareer Insights files:

- <strong>Moving Homes (with your parents):</strong> Maybe you have moved several times in your life, what did you learn from that. Maybe you only moved once before going to college, but that was either great or terrible.
- <strong>From home in high end town to college in old inner city:</strong> Unfortunately a lot of the older, very good schools, are "on the wrong side of the tracks". This may be the first time you have not lived in an upscale community.
- <strong>Changing Schools:</strong> Maybe you went from a large public elementary school to a small private middle school. Or from a small private middle school to a large public high school.
- <strong>Changing Schools:</strong> Maybe you went from a large public high school to a huge public college. Or from a small private high school to a private college that is still dramatically larger than your high school.
- <strong>Changing Sports Teams:</strong> Maybe you went from a friendly local soccer team to a competitive college prep team with kids from all over the area.
- <strong>Changing Sports Teams:</strong> Maybe you went from being a star on your club soccer team to being on the bench on your college soccer team.
- <strong>Parents getting Divorced:</strong> Maybe your parents got divorced and your life changed dramatically.
- <strong>Blended Family:</strong> Maybe your divorced mother got remarried and you now have a half sister and half brother around your age.
- <strong>Popular to Unpopular:</strong> Maybe you suddenly were no longer part of the "In" group. 
- <strong>Normal student to Leader:</strong> Maybe you became the President of your class and people treated you differently.
<ul>
</ul>
You can write your insights as either a separate document as Edward did. 
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-TransitionsInsights.pdf"target="_blank"> Edward's Transitions Insights</a> to see how he formatted his Transition insights. 
<ul>
</ul>
What he did was make each of his major Transitions a bullet in the Autobiography outline and then put a insight comment indented below the Major Transition. 
<ul>
</ul>
Or you can incorporate your Insights into your Transitions document by placing them at the end of the document as Casey did. She wrote three paragraphs.

<em>I realized the major academic transitions have been the hardest for me. I went to an all girls middle school where I had to make new friends and I was only around girls was hard for me to adapt too. Similarity, when I went to my large public high school, I had to transition back to being in a co-ed environment that wasn’t as creative or free as my small private all girls’ middle school. I was lucky to find a great group of girls who I love with all my heart. </em>

<em>Both transitions helped me prepare for the biggest one yet, moving all the way to the east coast for college where I only see my family and home friends every few months. It is very different on the east coast and I learned that you have to be outgoing if you want to make friends and meet people. 
</em>

<em>While these transitions have been difficult, they have helped me attain traits which I am most proud of today (my outgoing personality, optimistic attitude, being able to adapt to a new environment).</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey's examples above.

Be sure to add insights from this exercise to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> From looking at your Autobiography you should have been able to identify some natural strengths and indications of your natural personality. Have you ever dedicated yourself to one activity, e.g. soccer or theater, and become really good at it. Do people tell you that you are outgoing?
- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> You most likely have had some passions in your life as of now. Do you love theater, sports? Are you involved in any political activities. It doesn't mean those are the ones you will have going forward, but it is important to document them.
- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Can you tell if your current economic standard of living is higher or lower than the one you probably will be able to afford when you are age 30? If your parents live in an expensive home and work in high paying jobs it is doubtful you will be able to do that by age 30. But is that your expectation? Have you worked to pay your expenses or have your parents always paid all your expenses?
- <strong>Right Career (s):</strong> Maybe you have always wanted to be a jet pilot, Don did. Maybe when you were younger you wanted to be a coach. Even if you don't want to have those as a career now, write them down because they provide some insights into your thinking at that time. Do you have multiple ideas now that you have looked back over your life? They don't have to be realistic or even things that will survive further analysis. Write them down because they provide insights into your thought process.
- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> Most of your Autobiography probably goes into the Whole Person file. At this age your life so far has been about you as a Whole Person. Have you grown up in an upscale community? Are your parents well off? Have you traveled a lot growing up? Because of those things do you expect to live in a style like you were raised? Is your community very liberal/conservative? How does your extended family influence the type of world in which you want to live? Did you grow up in a place you can't imagine ever leaving, e.g. California, New England or the South.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser/Facilitator. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A) Discuss Content Issues</strong></h3>
These first items are content oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Autobiography Insights:</strong> This is a key document to discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Autobiography:</strong> This is a backup to the Insights. Remember it was not really written to be read so you will probably have to add some context for them.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Major Transitions Insights:</strong> Another key document to discuss</li>
<li><strong>Major Transitions:</strong> This is a backup and probably should be shown.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights Documents:</strong> This is the most important set of documents you have to discuss. You should have taken all of your findings in this exercise and placed them in the appropriate document - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. This is the first time you will have added insights to an existing document so it is important to see how your knowledge is growing.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B) Discuss Process Issues</strong></h3>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done four exercises. You may want to revise your schedule.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> You have just finished your fourth review, maybe the two of you want to do it differently in the future, or you now have a process that works for both of you.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these two exercises.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the same process we used in the Begin at the End Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h3>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: Autobiography, Transitions and Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h3>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>C) Don will load your Example on the Examples page</strong></h3>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page that was created in the Begin at the End exercise. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on one exercise and then not again for two exercises.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples this Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>0) Introduction</strong></H3> 
If you want to see the Introduction, including a video where Don describes the Autobiography concept and explains your Exercise via some examples, click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/loot-at-the-past/autobiography/step-0/">Step 0 - Introduction</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>1) Write your autobiography & Provide your Insights</strong></H3> in outline format using just bullets. Casey's example is:
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Autobiography.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography Insights</a>

Click on </strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Template-Autobiography.doc"target="_blank"> Autobiography Template</a>. This is a Word document with the outline for an autobiography. If you look at the Casey example you will see she basically used this same outline.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 1 - Write your Autobiography in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>2) Document your major transitions & Provide your Insights</strong></H3> 
that have occurred in your life. Casey's example is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Transitions.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Transitions & Insights</a> where Transitions are shown in Red and Major Transitions are show in Bold Red. Her insights are at the end of her Transitions document. You can also create a separate Transitions document.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 2 - Document your Transitions in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>3) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></H3> 
Document the insights you have gained from this exercise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples this Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. The Full Instructions are listed in the Sub Navigation panel on the right. You can always open one of them up if you want more help. There are also additional examples on the Examples page.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>0) Introduction</strong></h3>
So quickly what is the Begin at the End approach? Robert Fritz discovered it when he studied great artists. He found they used this technique to visualize their end result of playing the piano in Carnegie hall and working backwards to their current reality of playing piano in the 4th grade. 
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to learn more about the Begin at the End approach visit Step 0 - Introduction</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>1) Visualize yourself at Age 30 and Provide your Insights</strong></h3>
This exercise allows you to accomplish something very important – paint a picture, using the “Whole Person” parameters, of your life at age 30. You are more than just your Career, you have all of the other elements surrounding your Career. There are a lot more things to consider when choosing your Right Career than just the jobs you will have, e.g. where you want to live, your personal relationships and your family. 
<ul>
</ul>
No Career Visualized Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Madison-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Madison's End Result</a>
<ul>
</ul>
As an option you can add a vision of your career at Age 30. It might be a general idea, a range of alternatives or something very specific.
<ul>
</ul>
Career Visualized Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-EndResult-Age30.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's End Result</a>  
<ul>
</ul>
Out of School Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Carolyn-EndResult-Age30.pdf"target="_blank">Carolyn's End Result</a>. If you are already out of school than you want to use an age about 7 to 10 years in the future. Carolyn is 25 and she used age 35. 
<ul>
</ul>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Template-EndResult-Age30.doc"target="_blank">End Result Word Template</a> you will get a Word file that has a list of variables you can use to describe your life at Age 30. The variables are similar to the ones in the two examples above.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2) Work Backwards and Provide your Insights</strong></h3>
Now pick one category, e.g. Financial, Personal Relationship, Family, Career. With that one category you will work backwards from your Ultimate End Result (age 30) to your Intermediate End Result #3 (age 27) to your Intermediate End Result #2 (age 24) to your Intermediate End Result #1 (age 22). You can pick any ages for your Intermediate End Results that make sense for your life. The above are just to give you a starting point.
<ul>
</ul>
No Career Visualized Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Married-WorkBackwards.pdf"target="_blank">Married at Age 30</a>
<ul>
</ul>
Career Visualized Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-WorkBackwards.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Work Backwards</a> Casey's Age 30 End Result includes her vision of a career and this Work Backwards addresses the career aspect of that vision.
<ul>
</ul>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-WorkBackwards.doc"target="_blank">Casey's Work Backwards</a> you will get a Word file of how Casey worked backwards from her age 30 career idea to age 22, her graduation from college.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3) Create a Structural Tension document</strong></h3>
Now use the Structural Tension idea and create the objectives (try to keep it around 5 objectives) that would get you from your Current Reality to your Intermediate End Result #1.
<ul>
</ul>
Career Visualized Example: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-StructuralTension.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Structural Tension</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-StructuralTension.doc"target="_blank">Casey's Structural Tension</a> you will get a Word file of how Casey created a Structural Tension diagram between her Current Reality (summer between her Sophomore & Junior year) and her Intermediate End Result #1 (age 22 = graduation from college).
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4) Document your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h3>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How will you Measure Your Life and Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how she has added insights with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

</ul>
To find Word templates for these files go to the Templates page. Once you use the templates and enter your Begin at the End insights into each of the five files, store them some place you won't lose them. You will be adding to them as part of each Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>

Discuss the output of Steps 1, 2, 3 & 4 above.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Create a list of accomplishments, 2) Create a list of 3 to 10 major accomplishments you really enjoyed doing, 3) Create a list of 2 to 3 accomplishments you did not enjoy doing, 4) Document the insights you gained from the exercise (both enjoyed doing and didn't enjoy doing), 5) Provide feedback, 6) Discuss your completed exercise with your Facilitator and 7) Become an Example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. Steps 1 through 4 will probably take you about 2 hours.

Note: If you are an experienced adult, instead of a student, visit the "Experienced Adult" page before beginning this exercise.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Accomplishments_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Accomplishments Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the Autobiography Exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.

There are two approaches you can take to complete exercises: Short Instructions or Full Instructions. You can also use a hybrid approach in at least two different ways: 1) Use the Short Instructions for one Step and then switch to the Full Instructions on another Step if you need more help or 2) Use the Short Instructions on a Step until you need more help on that Step and then go directly to the Full Instructions on that Step for more instructions.
<h1><strong>click on <a href=" http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/loot-at-the-past/accomplishments/short-instructions/">Short Instructions Approach</a></strong></h1>
If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically listening to a 5 minute video and using examples to do your work.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/loot-at-the-past/accomplishments/step-0/">Step 0 - Introduction</a></strong></h1>
If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the same 5 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.]]></content:encoded>

Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 4 - Add to your MyRightCareer Insights in the Sub Navigation Panel on the upper right.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>5) Discuss your Results with Your Facilitator.</strong></H3> Discuss the output of Steps 1, 2, 3 & 4 above.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 5 - Discuss your Results with Your Facilitator in the Sub Navigation Panel on the upper right. 
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>6) Discuss with your Career Advisory Board.</strong></H3>
Now is time to discuss the results of your first two Assignments, Begin at the End and Look at the Past (Autobiography and Accomplishments), with your Career Advisory Board. At the minimum you need to send them your four MyRightCareer Insights files from your Accomplishments exercise: Be Your Best, Meaning & Passion, Economic Engine and Right Career. You only need to send them the files from your Accomplishments exercise because they are cumulative files and includes your insights from the Begin at the End, Autobiography and Accomplishments exercises. For each area, e.g. Be Your Best, you should  have a dialogue about what you have discovered about yourself relative to that element in the Right Career Venn diagram.

It is suggested you send them more than those four files and if you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 6 - Discuss with your Career Advisory Board in the Sub Navigation Panel on the upper right.

You should proceed with the next exercise while you are having discussions with your Career Advisory Board. Due to schedule conflicts it could take several weeks to complete this step and you can be working on the next exercise in parallel.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should watch the Welcome to Accomplishments video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as they do this exercise:
<h4><strong>List of All Accomplishments</strong></h4>
Encourage them to truly think of all of their accomplishments, even if they don't think they relate to their future career decision.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-All_Accomplishments.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's All Accomplishments List</a>
<h4><strong>List of Top Accomplishments</strong></h4>
Ensure they identify accomplishments they really enjoyed doing. And that they also created a couple of accomplishments they did, but didn't enjoy doing.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-All_Accomplishments_Top.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's All Accomplishments List - Top Highlighted</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-Top_Accomplishments.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Top Accomplishments</a>
<h4><strong>Document the Insights</strong></h4>
This may be the first time they broke their accomplishments into "I really liked doing this" and "I didn't enjoy doing this". If they were driven to build a list of accomplishments for their college application, whether they liked them or not probably didn't matter. This should provide some insights.

<h4><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents</strong></h4>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. They will be accumulating their insights about that circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably several weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached. Probably all they have to do is copy their insights from Step 3 to each of the MyRightCareer Insights files, as appropriate, and then add some more comments.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You need to create a list of Accomplishments from elementary school to today.

Below are examples of how Casey and Edward documented their Accomplishments:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-All_Accomplishments.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's All Accomplishments List</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-AllAccList.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's All Accomplishments List</a>

One way to figure out your Accomplishments is to print out your Autobiography. Then go through each segment of your life and try to remember the Accomplishments you had for that period. You will probably find some of the entries in your Autobiography are Accomplishments.

A simple way to organize these Accomplishments is to use the basic outline from your Autobiography. There is a template for that, click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Template-All_Accomplishments.doc"target="_blank">All Accomplishments Template</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 2 - List of Top Accomplishments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Step you need to decide two things about your list of Accomplishments:

- Those you really liked doing
- Those you didn't like doing, but still did

Normally you put Accomplishments on your resume that you know other people will find impressive. It doesn’t matter if you enjoyed doing them or not. You are looking for all the things that will sell you to others. You are looking for the things that are “hot” at this moment in time. You are creating a special resume for that target company. 

You clearly will probably have Accomplishments on your resume that you did not enjoy doing, we all do. But you would not openly say you didn't enjoy doing it, which we are going to do here.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Narrow List Down to Top Accomplishments</strong></h1>

A simple way to identify which are which is to make a copy of your All Accomplishments list file and append the word Top to the end of the file name, e.g. John-AllAccomplishments_Top.doc. Then highlight the ones you liked doing in Blue and the ones you didn't like doing in Red. Click below to see Casey and Don's examples:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-All_Accomplishments_Top.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's All Accomplishments List - Top Highlighted</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-AllAccList_Top.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's All Accomplishments List - Top Highlighted</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Really Liked Doing</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
Now make another pass through that file and mark the ones you Really Liked Doing in Bold Blue. Identify from 3 to 7 Accomplishments you Really Liked Doing. 

It is important to identify those Accomplishments you really liked doing for at least two reasons. First, you need to see these are different from the other Accomplishments. Second, this will help you identify Skills you really like using. Both of these insights will help you not only identify your Right Career but will help you perform better because when you are doing things you enjoy doing. 

<h1><strong>C) Didn't Like Doing</strong></h1>
Now make another pass through that file and mark the ones you Didn't Like Doing in Bold Red. We all perform tasks we don't like doing. That might be the definition of school. But you will find the same thing happens in work. It is valuable to identify those things you really don't like doing so you can avoid them if possible. When you get to the next Step, Insights, you will be asked to identify the Glass Half Full for these Accomplishments you didn't like doing. Most likely some good came of them.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>D) Run it by a Close Friend</strong></h1>
This is another exercise where you can use a friend to help you. Use the same friend who helped you with the Autobiography exercise. After you create your list of Accomplishments (You really liked Doing & Didn't like Doing) sit down and discuss that list with your friend. They will probably have a different view of which ones should be marked as Bold Blue and Bold Red. They will probably also give you some insights you can use in Step 3.

<h1><strong>D) Top Accomplishments List</strong></h1>
Now you are going to create a document that only has your Accomplishments you really liked doing (Bold Blue) and you didn't like doing (Bold Red). The simplest way to do that is to create a copy of the AllAccomplishments_Top file and name it TopAccomplishments. Then go in and delete every Accomplishment that is not either Bold Blue or Bold Red.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Step you need to document the insights you have gained from creating a list of your Accomplishments, deciding which ones you really liked doing and which ones you did not like doing. We suggest your Insights document have three sections:

- General
- Liked
- Didn't Like

I suggest you write the last two sections first and then see if there are some insights you can fit into either of those two categories, which you can then place in the General category. If you find every Insight is General that is fine too. Most likely you will end up with at least some "Didn't Like" Insights, as well as General Insights.

Here are Casey and Edward's Accomplishment's Insights:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Casey-AccomplishmentsInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Accomplishments Insights</a>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-AccomplishmentsInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Accomplishments Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Really Liked Doing</strong></h1>
Look at all the Accomplishments you labeled Bold Blue and see what insights you can draw from those. There may be some themes that run through those Accomplishments. Maybe they have changed from Middle School to High School and then again in College. If your schools were dramatically different, e.g. a small all girls middle school to a large co-ed public high school, that could impact your Accomplishments. What insights did you gain as to your natural strengths. Did the Accomplishments you like create any feeling of passion within you?
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Really Didn't Like Doing</strong></h1>
We all have to do things we don't like doing. But often we can not avoid doing them. If you want to be a great basketball player you are going to have to do a lot of running and maybe you hate just running. You have probably heard the Glass Half Full analogy. Take the one or two things you have identified you didn't like doing (the Glass Half Empty) and write what positive things came from that Accomplishment (Glass Half Full). Maybe you really hate math, but had to take quite a bit of it. The Glass Half Full part might be that you learned how to work hard and do well in a subject that is not a natural strength for you. It showed you that it is possible to "tough" it out when you have no choice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey's examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> Does an Accomplishment point to a natural strength. Does your natural personality become obvious when you see the types of Accomplishments you gravitate towards.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> In that group of Accomplishments you Really Liked Doing do you see a Passion for something?

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Does any Accomplishment provide clues as to how you are going to earn the income to support your economic desires?

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> Would you like to repeat any of those Accomplishments over and over again, e.g. writing articles for a living?

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> Are some of those accomplishments not career oriented, e.g. sports? Are there things that give you an idea of your Whole Person in those accomplishments?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>A) Introduction</strong></h1>
Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser/Facilitator. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared some of your Major Accomplishments. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
These first items are content oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Top Accomplishments</strong></strong> Use the full list, annotated with the Bold Blue (ones you really liked doing) and Bold Red (ones you didn't like doing). This will allow you to have a discussion as to why you picked the Bold Blue and Bold Red Accomplishments our of the Total List. It will also allow you to discuss the total list.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Accomplishments Insights:</strong> They will be very interested in this document.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights Documents:</strong> This is the most important set of documents you have to discuss. You should have taken all of your findings in this exercise and placed them in each of the four documents. There are four of these - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine and Right Opportunities. This is the third time you will have added insights to an existing document so it is important to discuss how your knowledge is growing. You and your Facilitator can see if any patterns are developing.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>C) Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done five exercises. You and your Adviser/Facilitator may want to revise your schedule.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser/Facilitator Review Process:</strong> You have just finished your 5th review, maybe the two of you want to do it differently in the future, or you now have a process that works for both of you.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these three exercises.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the same process we used in the Autobiography exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: All Accomplishments, Top Accomplishments and Accomplishments Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>C) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page that was created in the Begin at the End exercise. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on Exercise #2 and then not again until Exercise #4 and #5.

</ul>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> There are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Career" and one for "Whole Person". This exercise has added a set of insights to each file. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
These five documents are examples of the insights obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How to Measure your Life and Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

As a student you will notice these people had to choose which of many accomplishments (e.g. Bud had 10 from elementary school through grad school, 41 from grad school to age 44 and 4 that were purely personal, e.g. becoming a father) they want to call their Major Accomplishments. Bud then chose 7 Major Accomplishments out of all of that large group. Most likely you had the opposite problem, trying to find enough accomplishments to reach the suggested total.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bud</strong></h3>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-AllAccList_Age44.pdf"target="_blank"> Bud's All Accomplishments List</a> 
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-Major-Acc-Top-7-Age-44.pdf"target="_blank"> Bud's Top 7 Accomplishments List</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Matt</strong></h3>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Matt-Top-Accomplishments.pdf"target="_blank"> Matt's Accomplishments List</a>. Matt has both his total Accomplishments and his Top Accomplishments in the same document. He only covered his professional accomplishments.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Checklist</strong></h2>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Accomplishments_Checklist.pdf"target="_blank">Accomplishments Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the Accomplishments Exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
On this page are two templates you can use. At the top is a template for the All Accomplishments document. At the bottom of the page is the Autobiography Checklist which allows you to keep track of the status of the sub-exercises in the Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Template</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>All Accomplishments:</strong> <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Template-All_Accomplishments.doc"target="_blank">All Accomplishments Template</a> This is a Word file with the outline for an All Accomplishments document. If you look at the Don or Casey examples you will see they basically used this same outline.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Top Accomplishments:</strong> There is no template for this. The simplest way to create this document is to highlight your Top Accomplishments, the ones you liked doing and the ones you didn't like doing, in your All Accomplishments document. Then you can make a copy of that document and delete all the ones that are not highlighted.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Accomplishments Insights:</strong> There is no template for this. If you create a separate Insights document consider using your Accomplishments structure as the organizing mechanism for your insights. Both Casey and Don used that approach. You can also put your insights as the end of your Accomplishments document or your Top Accomplishments document
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Checklist</strong></h2>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Accomplishments_Checklist.xls"target="_blank">Accomplishments Checklist Template</a> you will be able to down the Excel file that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in this exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. Both of you can get the file from this Templates page.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>File Naming</strong></h2> 
You should save any file you down load on your computer. Then create another copy with your name appended on the front of that file. You can then fill in your own information in that new file. If you someway screw up that file you can download the template again and not overwrite the one with your data. This way you may be able to copy some of your data from your partly damaged file to the new template.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should now understand your Accomplishments from elementary school through college. This list will be helpful as you build your Sales Story.

From this list of Accomplishments you have also identified those that you really enjoyed doing. People generally perform better when they work at things they enjoy doing so you should pick a career that involves activities similar to these Accomplishments. Out in the Work World you may not be repeating all of these Accomplishment because they are school oriented. But the insights you have gained should provide guidance what the Accomplishments have in common that you can apply in the Work World.

You have also identified those Accomplishments you didn't really enjoy doing. Of course you would not like to have a career that involved this type of work. But hopefully your Glass Half Full exercise let you see what things you learned from these Accomplishments you can apply to your career. It should have also prepared you to take the same Glass Half Full attitude toward future task you know you will not enjoy, but have to be performed as part of your otherwise very enjoyable career. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<strong>What you do must have Meaning,i.e. what you do must matter deeply to you</strong>. 
It’s something you’re so passionate about that you lose all track of time when you do it. In fact it may not feel like work at all. It seduces you to the point where you lose interest in everything else.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>The bad news is that it’s really dangerous not to do what you love.</strong> 
The harsh truth is that if you don’t love what you’re doing, you’ll lose to someone who does. Your co-workers or competitors who love their work will gladly work longer hours, think about work 24/7, try more things, come up with more great ideas and get better opportunities than people who only do things for a living.
<ul>
</ul>
But you might say I am not driven by a vision like Gandhi or Steve Jobs. In the Success Built to Last video clip about Herb Kelleher, co-founder of Southwest Airlines, you will hear “It only has to move you”. Herb was moved by the idea of making air travel affordable to the average person, so families could get together for holidays, so small business could compete with big business. He was not trying to save the world, but this Vision had meaning to him and he built a company where it had meaning to everyone else in the company.



<h1><strong>Exercises</strong></h1>
This Assignment has the following exercises. 
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h3><strong>Success Built to Last</strong></h3></li>
To see the detail for this exercise click on its name in the Sub Navigation section on the right. You need to watch 4 short Video Clips from the co-authors of Success Built to Last as they explain the findings of their research. People who achieve lasting success are rare and the authors set out to find out what sets them apart. Hear the author's explain how they found these people and discovered their secrets to building success that lasts. This exercise will take about 20 minutes. It is a subset of the Success Built to Last course in the Pre-Requisites Assignment. Even if you watched it there it is suggested you watch again as you now try to identify what has meaning to you.
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h3><strong>Stories</strong></h3></li>
To see the detail for this exercise click on its name in the Sub Navigation section on the right. You need to: 1) Write stories about two of your Major Accomplishments you enjoyed doing, 2) Write a story about an accomplishment you did not enjoy doing, 3) Document your Insights for each story, 4) Provide feedback, 5) Discuss your completed exercise with your Facilitator and 6) Become an Example. Each story will take about an hour to write, with another 15 minutes to add your insights. The exercise should take about 4 hours. 
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The content is composed of a Prerequisite Assignment, six Insights Assignments and a Capstone Assignment. Below are short descriptions of each Assignment and the exercises within that Assignment.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h1>
Before beginning the MyRightCareer Program you have to complete the Pre-Requisites exercises: Right Career Concept Overview, Program Approach, Program Content, Benefits, Adviser & Career Advisory Board and Feedback. The estimated completion time for these exercises is between 2 and 3 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Insights Assignments</strong></h1>
These are the six Assignments that will, when completed, provide the insights for the Capstone project. These will take approximately 35 to 40 hours to complete.

	<li><h4><strong>Begin at the End Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment only has one Exercise. This will take approximately 4 hours to complete. You will learn how to throw away the constraints of today and visualize what your life could be (or you would like it to be) at age 30. The Assignment will concentrate on your Whole Person - those parts of your life outside of your career. You will learn how to use the approach of working backwards from that vision, not working forwards from your current reality. Working forwards will almost always convince you that it can't be done. But working backwards you can arrive at a milestone close to your Current Reality that is a realistic objective.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Look at Self Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment has two Exercises. Completing all of the exercises will take approximately 8 hours.

<strong>Personality</strong>: You will also learn about your Meyers-Briggs Personality Type and find out how you can "Do What You Are". Estimated time is 3.5 hours.

<strong>Interests</strong>: You will learn what careers and occupations might be a good fit for you based on your Strong Interest Inventory assessment. You will also learn which majors are a good fit for those interests. You will look at an additional report that provides guidance from combining your Meyers-Briggs assessment and your Strong Interest Inventory. Estimated time is 3.5 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Look at the Past Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment has 2 Exercises. Completing all of the exercises will take approximately 6 hours.

<strong>Autobiography</strong>: You will create an Autobiography, in a bullet format. This will start with a brief look at your Ancestors and then examine your life from elementary school through college. Estimated time is 3 hours.

<strong>Accomplishments</strong>: You will identify your accomplishments from your early years until now. You will then identify 3 to 7 accomplishments you have really enjoyed doing and 1 or 2 you didn't like doing. Estimated time is 2.5 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Identify Strengths Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment has two Exercises. Completing all of the exercises will take approximately 6 hours.

<strong>Skills</strong>: In the Skills exercise you identify Skills you really enjoy using. In this exercise you will use what you learned in the Accomplishments Exercise. Estimated time is 2.5 hours.

<strong>Talents/Strengths</strong>: You will learn what your natural Talents/Strengths are and some Action Steps you can take to leverage them in your day-to-day life. It involves taking an assessment called StrengthsFinder 2.0. Estimated time is 3 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Examine Meaning &amp; Passion Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment has four exercises. Completing all of the exercises will take approximately 10 hours.

<strong>Success Built to Last</strong>: You will watch four short video clips from the author's of Success Built to Last's TV Program. You will then create a short document describing how you believe you can apply what you learned to your life. Estimated time is 1 hour.

<strong>Stories</strong>: You will write a one page stories about two of the Accomplishment you have really enjoyed doing. You will write a one page story about an Accomplishment you did not enjoy doing. For all three stories you will document the insights you gained from looking at these accomplishments in more detail. Estimated time is 4 hours.

<strong>Drivers</strong>: In the Drivers exercise you will identify those things, besides money, that really motivate you. Estimated time is 2 hours.

<strong>Measure Your Life</strong>: You will answer three basic questions. How can I be sure I will be successful and happy in my career? How can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse, my children, my extended family and close friends become an enduring source of happiness? How can I live a life of integrity — and stay out of jail? Estimated time is 2 hours.

<strong>Meaning Insights</strong>: Your assignment involves two steps: 1) Review your existing MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights file and 2) Create a Meaning Insights Summary. Estimated time is 2 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Understand your Economic Engine Assignment</strong></h4></li>
This Assignment has two required exercises. The Basic Assignment (Steps 1 &amp; 2) will take you about 2 hours, with another hour for the Insights/etc. Each of the Optional Exercises will add another hour. If you did all of the exercises this Assignment would take around 6 hours to complete.

<strong>Age 30 Budget</strong>: Estimate your Age 30 Budget - Income, Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses and Non-Discretionary Expenses. You will be putting dollars to the Age 30 Vision you created in the Begin at the End Assignment.

<strong>Age 22 Budget</strong>: Estimate your Age 22 Budget - Income, Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses and Non-Discretionary Expenses. This will be the budget for your first year out of college and will assume you get a professional job, hopefully in your Right Career.

<strong>Optional exercises</strong>: It has three optional exercises: 3) Age 22 Non Professional Job (what if you don't get that professional job and have to support yourself), 4) Financials of Buying a House and 5) Financials of Raising a Family.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Capstone Project</strong></h1>
The last Assignment is your Capstone Project that pulls everything you learned together and allows you to achieve the first two goals of the MyRightCareer Program. This Assignment has 4 Exercises. Completing all of the exercises will take approximately 15 hours. It is recommended you allow 3 weeks to complete the Capstone Project because it requires reflection to identify your Right Career (s).

	<li><h4><strong>Identify your Right Career (s) Exercise</strong></h4></li>
You put everything you have learned about yourself together to identify your 1st Pass at your Right Career (s). It will involve all of the MyRightCareer Insights you have been accumulating in the three circles on the MyRightCareer Venn diagram: Be Your Best (leveraging your natural strengths &amp; personality), Meaning &amp; Passion and your Economic Engine. You will also want to take into account the insights contained in the Whole Person file. Estimated time is 6 hours.

	<li><h4><strong>Validate your Right Career Choice (s)</strong></h4></li>
You will identify some resources (e.g Web sites, Books) that will allow you to research your target industry, target role, Whole Person Issues (e.g. where you want to live). Using the knowledge you have gained in the research you can identify people in that career area with whom you should meet (in person, on the phone or by email). They will provide even more insights that will allow you to validate if the career you identified is your <strong>Right </strong>Career. Estimated time is 5.5 hours.

	<li><h4><strong>Build a Sales Story Exercise</strong></h4></li>
You will take the information you used to identify your Right Career and build a Sales Story to convince potential employers you are the <strong>Right </strong>person for your <strong>Right </strong>Career. Estimated time is 2.5 hours.

	<li><h4><strong>Create a Follow-on Plan Exercise</strong></h4></li>
You will also create a Follow-on Plan so you don't lose the momentum you have generated during the Program. The length of the plan will depend on your situation, e.g. Casey’s is a 2 year plan, while Edward's is only a 9 month plan. You might want to take the Follow-on Plan back to your school Career Center (some times it is called the Career Development Center or Career Services) and get their help in implementing it. Estimated time is 1.5 hours.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Take the Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory assessments, 2) Create the "Do What You Are" report, 3) Create your Personality Insights, 4) Perform a Self Assessment of your Myers-Briggs Type, 5) Validate your Meyers-Briggs Type, 6) Create your Career Insights, 7) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 8 Provide feedback, 9) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator and 10) Become an example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. In total the first seven steps will probably take you about 4 hours.

Note: If you are an experienced adult, instead of a student, visit the "Experienced Adult" page before beginning this exercise.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Personality_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Personality Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.

There are two approaches you can take to complete exercises: Short Instructions or Full Instructions. You can also use a hybrid approach in at least two different ways: 1) Use the Short Instructions for one Step and then switch to the Full Instructions on another Step if you need more help or 2) Use the Short Instructions on a Step until you need more help on that Step and then go directly to the Full Instructions on that Step for more instructions.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=2250">Short Instructions Approach</a></strong></h1>
If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically very short instructions (a few sentences) and using examples to do your work.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=2252">Full Instructions</a></strong></h1>
If you would like a full set of instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> There are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Career" and one for "Whole Person". This exercise has added a set of insights to each file. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How will you Measure Your Life and Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how she has added insights with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples this Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. The Full Instructions are listed in the Sub Navigation panel on the right. You can always open one of them up if you want more help. There are also additional examples on the Examples page.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>0) Introduction</strong></H3> 
Personality type is such a critical ingredient in career satisfaction because it helps people identify four of the most important features that make us who we are: how we get energy, take in information, make decisions and organize our world. And while every individual is certainly unique – we all have different genes, parents, backgrounds, etc. – people of the same personality type have a tremendous amount in common, especially with regards to what makes them satisfied and successful in their work.
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to watch a 7 minute video explaining the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or a video where Don explains your Exercise via some examples, click on Step 0 - Introduction in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>1) Take the Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory assessments</strong></H3> 
To understand how to access the appropriate Web site go to Step 1 - Take the Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory assessments. </a> You will only be using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report in this exercise. 

Casey's report is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-Myers-Briggs_Report.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Report</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>2) Create the "Do What You Are" report.</strong></H3> 
To understand how to access the appropriate Web site go to Step 2 - Create the "Do What You Are" report. </a>

Casey's example is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-ENFJ.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Report</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>3) Create your Personality Insights</strong></H3> 
Create a Personality Insights document using information from your “Do What You Are” report. The Insights document should mirror the sections in the Do What You Are document. 
<ul>
</ul>
Casey's example is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Personality_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Personality Insights</a>. 
<ul>
</ul>
</strong> <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Template-Personality_Insights.doc"target="_blank"> Personality Insights Word template</a> This is a Word file with the outline for the Personality Insights document.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>4) Perform a Self Assessment of your Myers-Briggs Type.</strong></H3> 
To perform this self assessment use this <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MBTI_SelfAssessment.xls"target="_blank"> MBTI Self Assessment template</a> This is an Excel file with four pages - one for each of the four elements in the Meyers-Briggs Type (e.g. Extroversion vs. Introversion). There are nine characteristics for each element and you place an X next to the ones you feel represent you.
<ul>
</ul>
Casey's example is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-MBTI_SelfAssessment.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Meyers-Briggs Self Assessment</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>5) Validate your Meyers-Briggs Type.</strong></H3> 
Look at the two types of insights you gained in the previous Step: Self-Assessment Worksheet and Outside Feedback. Now create a document where you provide your logic for what your “true” personality type should be.
<ul>
</ul>
Casey's example is: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-ValidateMeyers-BriggsType_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Validated MBTI</a>
<ul>
</ul>
There is no template for this step.
<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>6) Careers Insights.</strong></H3> 
You have now validated your Myers-Briggs Type, e.g. Casey decided she was an ENFJ, even though her self assessment said she was an ENFP. So the next step is to analyze what that means from a career viewpoint. To do that you will use your “Do What You Are” report. It has sections that provide you information about: What you need in a career for it to be satisfying; Some satisfying career fields and jobs for your Myers-Briggs type (examples of careers many people of your Type find satisfying) and How to use your personality type strengths to conduct a successful job search.
<ul>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<H3><strong>7) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></H3> 
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples below.

<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to watch a 7 minute video explaining the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The video was created by PersonalityDesk, the people from whom you will take the Myers-Briggs assessment. If you feel you already know what the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is you don't need to watch this video. 
<ul>
</ul>
Personality type is such a critical ingredient in career satisfaction because it helps people identify four of the most important features that make us who we are: how we get energy, take in information, make decisions and organize our world. And while every individual is certainly unique – we all have different genes, parents, backgrounds, etc. – people of the same personality type have a tremendous amount in common, especially with regards to what makes them satisfied and successful in their work.

Quite simply, when we using our natural, inborn personality type preferences – our gifts – (yes, you are born with a type!), people feel energized, motivated and satisfied. Conversely, when we are doing tasks that are not natural to us, it drains our energy and we are less successful. The only factor that remains constant over the entire course of a person’s lifetime is their Personality Type.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Exercise</strong></h1>

<h3><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-5-Personality.wmv" target="_blank">Welcome to the Personality Exercise</a></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to see a video where Don explains your Exercise via some examples.

At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Take the Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory assessments, 2) Create the "Do What You Are" report, 3) Create your Myers-Briggs Type Insights, 4) Perform a Self Assessment of your Myers-Briggs Type, 5) Validate your Meyers-Briggs Type, 6) "Do What You Are" Analysis & Insights, 7) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 8 Provide feedback, 9) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator and 10) Become an example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. In total the first seven steps will probably take you about 4 hours.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should watch the Welcome to Personality Exercise video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as they do this exercise:
<h4><strong>Take the Assessments</strong></h4>
They should be able to do this on their own. While they will get two reports, they will only use one (Myers-Briggs Type Indicate Career Report) for this exercise. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-Myers-Briggs_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Report</a> to see an example, she is an ENFJ. If you have not taken a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Assessment you may want to watch this 7 minute video which explains it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQoOqQiVzwQ" target="_blank">Discover Your Personality Type Video</a>
<h4><strong>"Do What You Are" Report</strong></h4>
They should also be able to do this without any assistance and receive the report. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-ENFJ.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Report</a> to see an example. The “Do What You Are” Report provides a better analysis of the career aspects of their Meyers-Briggs Type than the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report they obtained in Step 1. But the “Do What You Are” Report requires them to enter Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator, e.g. ENFJ, they discovered in Step 1.
<h4><strong>Personality Insights</strong></h4>
They will be analyzing the personality description from the "Do What You Are" Report (which is based on their Meyers-Briggs Type, e.g. ENFJ). This will probably be the first time they have done any formal analysis of their personality. See if it matches your assessment of their personality. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Personality_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Personality Insights</a> to see an example.
<h4><strong>Self Assessment</strong></h4>
You should provide them with a reality-check on their personality, ENFJ. If you know them well enough to believe they are off base on one of the four preferences then have that discussion with them now. If you don't know them that well encourage them to seek input from peers, employers, coaches, relatives, etc. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-MBTI_SelfAssessment.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Self Assessment</a> to see an example.

They may be projecting how they want to be, not how they really are. For example on the preference of "How you make decisions": Thinkers vs. Feelers they may have assessed themselves as a Feeler, while the Meyers-Briggs assessment tool categorized them as a Thinker. They may see themselves as a Feeler because they want to be in jobs that require diplomacy and they know they can take other people's feelings into account when making decisions. But you and others may know them well enough to see their most natural decision making approach is to make decisions objectively through rational arguments. It is not that they can't be diplomatic and won't take other people's feelings into account, it just isn't their first approach.
<h4><strong>Validate Meyers-Briggs Type</strong></h4>
So now they have to take the official Myers-Briggs Personality Type, their Self Assessment, your input, their peers/family input and come up with what they believe is their true personality type. This is an extremely important decision for them because their personality will not change and will have a huge impact on their success and happiness in their career. Make sure they have made a wise choice. This could be real easy because every assessment points to the same personality, e.g. ENFJ.

<h4><strong>Career Insights</strong></h4>
See if the careers and jobs they picked from the lists provided make sense to you.

Remind them they will have a chance to revisit career insights in the next Exercise. Here they combine their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, e.g. ENFJ, with the Interests they previously identified when they took the Strong Interest Inventory Assessment.

These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. They will be accumulating their insights about that circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably quite a few weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached.

From the Personality exercise they should get some great insights for the "Be Your Best" file because they will have identified their natural personality. They will also be receiving their first direct recommendations that can be used in the "Right Careers" file.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You are going to take two assessments during this Step:

- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

- Strong Interest Inventory

We will only be using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment output during the Personality exercise. You are taking them at the same time because the assessment Web site we are using combines the results of the two assessments and we will see that combination in the Interests exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assessment Access - Your Career Center</strong></h1>
Once the system reaches Beta Test the students will have to take all their Assessments (i.e. Myers-Briggs, Do What You Are, Strong Interest Inventory and StrengthsFinder 2.0) through their Career Center (sometimes called a Career Development Center or Career Services).

During this Alpha Test we want to test how well this works by having you go to your Career Center for these Assessments. For this exercise we would like you to see if your Career Center offers the combined Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory Assessment. If so please take it through the Career Center and then use the output to finish this exercise (Personality) and the next exercise (Interests).

If they don't offer the combined Assessment, but do offer each of them independently go ahead and take them in that format. Again use the output of each assessment to finish this exercise (Personality) and the next exercise (Interests).
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assessment Access - No Career Center Support</strong></h1>
If your Career Center does not support either of the above asseessments (a very unlikely event since they are long time career planning tools) you will have to pay to take them via a 3rd party provider. The combined Myers-Brigss and Strong Interest Inventory Assessment is $99. 

In that case you need to tell Don you were not able to take the assessments through your Career Center and some of the reasons why not. We would like to understand the problems of taking these assessments via the student's Career Center. Don will then email you the $99.

Below is a link to the Personalitydesk Web site where you can purchase the Myers-Briggs and Strong Interest Inventory assessments. 

<h3><a href="http://www.personalitydesk.com/product/strong-mbti-career-package" target="_blank">Personalitydesk Web site - Combined Assessment</a></h3>

You want to select the "Standard" version, not the "College" version. 

Personalitydesk will email you a Login and Password, plus the link to the SkillsOne Web site where you will take the combined assessments. When you login with your Login and Password you will notice there is also a User ID field. Leave it blank on your first login. A User ID will be generated and e-mailed to you after you begin your assessment. It can be used to access your reports later.

Once logged in, you will see a list of several assessments. Please complete only the MBTI Step I (Form M) and the Strong Interest Inventory.

Please enter a valid email on the testing site so that PersonalityDesk may contact you. If you have any difficulty accessing your assessment, please e-mail them at service@personalitydesk.com and reference the Order Number your received in the email that contained your Login and Password.

Each assessment takes about 30 minutes so ensure you have an hour to complete them.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Web site Output</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report</strong></h3>
Your report will be emailed to you within 12 hours of completing the assessment during normal business hours in the U.S. After 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time your report will be emailed the next morning. Reports are emailed once a day on the weekends. 

The file comes with a long string of numbers as its name, we suggest you change the name to: YourName-Myers-Briggs_Report.pdf. You will use this report in this Personality exercise. Below is an example:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-Myers-Briggs_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Casey-Myers-Briggs_Report - </a>

The only part of this report you will be using in this Personality exercise is Summary of Your MBTI® Results, which is page 3 of the report. Print out this page because you will use it in the later steps. Below are two examples of page 3:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MBTI_Career_Report-Page3.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Summary of Your Myers-Briggs Results (Page 3)</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MBTI_Career_Report-Page3.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Summary of Your Myers-Briggs Results (Page 3)</a>

Study the two sections of page 3 (Summary of Your Myers-Briggs Results):
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Examples</strong></h3>

For each of the four preferences read and understand which one of the Myers-Briggs assessment indicates your preference. Casey prefers to "Make Decisions" by <strong>Feeling</strong>, i.e. based primarily on values and subjective evaluations of people-centered concerns. Edward prefers to "Make Decisions by <strong>Thinking</strong>, i.e. based primarily on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect.
	<li><strong>Casey - ENFJ</strong>
<strong>E (Extraversion) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I focus on the outer world of people and activity
<strong>N (Intuition) - Clarity is Slight:</strong> I take in information from patterns and the big picture and focus on future possibilities
<strong>F (Feeling) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I make decisions based on vales and subjective evaluation of people-centered concerns
<strong>J (Judging) - Clarity is Clear:</strong> I like a planned and organized approach, plus I want to have things settled</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Edward - INTJ</strong>
<strong>I (Introversion) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I focus on the inner world of ideas and impressions
<strong>N (Intuition) - Clarity is Clear:</strong> I take in information from patterns and the big picture and focus on future possibilities
<strong>T (Thinking) - Clarity is Moderate, almost Clear</strong>: I make decisions based on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect
<strong>J (Judging) - Clarity is Very Clear:</strong> I like a planned and organized approach, plus I want to have things settled</li>
<ul>
</ul>
Clarity of Report Preferences:</strong> For each of the four preferences look at how clear you were in expressing your preference for a particular pole over its opposite (i.e. your Clarity). A longer bar suggests you are quite sure about your preference, while a shorter bar suggests you are less sure about your preference. Casey and Edward both prefer to "Take in Information" from patterns and the big picture and focus on future, thus they are both Intuitives (N's). But Casey only has a <strong>Slight Clarity</strong> with a score of 3 out of 30. In contrast Edward has a <strong>Clear Clarity</strong> with a score of 19 out of 30. As you can see Casey's line is very short and Edward's line is quite long. It is very clear that Edward is an Intuitive, while Casey is not so clear.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Meaning of Preference:</strong> The Myers-Briggs Type doesn't mean Casey doesn't ever make decisions based on logic and an objective analysis of cause and effect. It just means she will normally make decisions based values and subjective evaluations of people-centered concerns. That is her natural approach to decision making. Edward is the same way. He of course can make decisions based on values and subjective evaluations of people-centered concerns. But when faced with a decision his normal approach will be based on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect. We all use both poles of the preferences.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Strong Interest Inventory® and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® Career Report</strong></h3>
Your report will be emailed to you within 12 hours of completing the assessment during normal business hours in the U.S. After 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time your report will be emailed the next morning. Reports are emailed once a day on the weekends.

Along with the report an optional one-hour consultation session by phone or email is available. Instructions for receiving that consultation will be included in the email containing the report. If you want to take advantage of the optional one-hour consultation session you should wait until you start the Interests exercise.

The file comes with a long string of numbers as its name, we suggest you change the name to: YourName-StrongMBTI_Report.pdf. You will use this report in the next exercise. Make sure you store this somewhere you can find it when needed in the next exercise. Below is an example:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
The "Do What You Are" Report provides a better analysis of the career aspects of your Meyers-Briggs Type than the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report you obtained in Step 1. But the “Do What You Are” Report requires you to enter Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator, e.g. INTJ, you discovered in Step 1.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>"Do What You Are" Report - Your Career Center</strong></h1>
As was described in Step 1 when the system reaches Beta Test the students will have to take all their Assessments (i.e. Myers-Briggs, Do What You Are, Strong Interest Inventory and StrengthsFinder 2.0) through their Career Center.

During this Alpha Test we want to test how well this works by having you go to your Career Center for these Assessments. For this exercise we would like you to see if your Career Center offers the "Do What You Are" Report. If so please obtain it through the Career Center and then use the Do What You Are report to finish this exercise (Personality). 

This report is based on the best selling book "Do What You Are". It is a perfect complement to the Myers-Briggs assessment. Your Career Center may not realize this and you could suggest they pay for you to get the "Do What You Are" report as a way for them to experiment (for only $29). 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>"Do What You Are" Report - No Center Support</strong></h1>
If your Career Center does not provide the "Do What You Are" Report or will not experiment you will have to pay for it from the PersonalityType.com. 

In that case you need to tell Don you were not able to take the assessments through your Career Center and some of the reasons why not. We would like to understand the problems of taking these assessments via the student's Career Center. Don will then email you the $29.
<ul>
</ul>
You already know your MBTI Type, e.g. INTJ, from your Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report so you can skip their simple personality assessment at the start of their Web site. Click on the link below and it will take you to their Web site:

<h3><a href="http://www.personalitytype.com/" target="_blank"> Do What You Are</a></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
On the left side of the page you will find
- The large heading "Know your type already?"
- Under that heading will be "Select from the 16 Personality Types"
- Next will be "Enter it here:"
- Finally there is a pop up menu box with the 16 Personality Types. You need to find yours, e.g INTJ, and click on it.

Then you will be taken to a page where
- you will have to fill in your name and email address.
- You will then be asked to pay for the report ($29).
- You will have the chance to create a user name and password.
- You will then be taken to a library where you can download the 15 page "Do What You Are" report like the ones shown for Casey and Edward below.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>"Do What You Are" Report Explanation</strong></h1>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-ENFJ.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Report - ENFJ</a>

This report is highlighted to show the items Edward thought applied quite well to his life and career. You may want to do the same with your copy of your "Do What You Are" Report.
<ul>
</ul>
The "Do What You Are" report takes your Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator (e.g. INTJ) and uses it to receive a very insightful analysis of your potential career (s). The assessment is provided by an organization called PersonalityType.com. Their tag line is “Discover your perfect career”. The content comes from the very successful book “Do What You Are”, one of my favorite books that I just rediscovered. I am amazed at how insightful their assessment was for me.

My feedback on what they provide comes from a 40 year career so I can judge whether their assessment is really accurate (at least for me). The assessment tool provides:

<strong>General Description</strong>: I found it much better than the one provided by the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report. It provides the description in a more conversational manner. I felt it was describing me.

<strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong>: I was amazed how “right on” this assessment was (for me). For both the strengths and weaknesses they have you choose 5 from a list of 13. The lists were very relevant and the five strengths and weaknesses really were the ones I have experienced during my career. I could see how much my personality had driven my career.

<strong>Career Satisfiers</strong>: In this case they also ask you to pick five from a list of 10. All ten were ones I found relevant and I could easily narrow it down to five very important items that I found made jobs satisfying to me (and ones that made jobs miserable).

<strong>Satisfying Career Fields and Jobs</strong>: There were a large number that I could have gone into and several I did go into.

<strong>Using your personality strengths to conduct a successful job search</strong>: These were insights that I had discovered the hard way, through trial and error over many years.

<strong>The Secret to Success</strong>: It provided three insights that I wished I had known when I was starting my career. They were so true it was amazing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Although the Myers-Briggs Type assessment is one of the most reliable self-report personality instruments available, no inventory is perfect. You may not feel entirely comfortable that your reported type, e.g. ENFJ, accurately describes you. The insights you gained in Step 3 from analyzing either of the two reports may have confirmed that for you. 

	<li>Summary of your Myers-Briggs Type Results: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MBTI_Career_Report-Page3.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Summary (page 3)</a></li>

	<li>"Do What Your Are" General Description: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-TypeDescr.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Description</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
In Step 3 you created your personality insights document, for example <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Personality_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Personality Insights</a>. In it you provided your insights of the personality the Myers-Briggs Type assessment tool had assigned to you and the "Do What You Are" document had described.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
Even if you are comfortable with the type, e.g. ENFJ, you received from your Myers-Briggs Type assessment you should perform a self assessment. You can do this in two steps. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Self-Assessment Worksheet</strong></h3>
Here are two examples of using the Self-Assessment Worksheet:
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-MBTI_SelfAssessment.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Self Assessment</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MBTI_SelfAssessment.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Myers-Briggs Self Assessment</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
These have been created with an Excel file that has four pages - one for each of the four Preference pairs in the Myers-Briggs Type (e.g. Extroversion vs. Introversion). 

To perform this self assessment use this template. <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MBTI_SelfAssessment.xls"target="_blank"> Self Assessment Excel template</a> There are nine characteristics for each Preference pair and you place an X next to the characteristics you feel represent you.

The Excel spreadsheet adds up the number of X's in each column. This makes it easy to see which of the two preferences you choose most often. For example in Casey's "What kind of environment makes you most comfortable?" section she has 3 X's for "Judgers often" and 6 X's for "Perceivers often" She then placed a red X in the box next to Perceiver as her personal assessment of that Preference pair.

On the fourth page her self assessment was an ENFP. Her official Myers-Briggs Type is an ENFJ so they don't match on the fourth preference "What kind of environment makes you most comfortable?" Her self assessment is she is a Perceiver (P) and her official Myers-Briggs Type is she is a Judger (J).
<ul>
</ul>
Make sure you create a "Do What You Are" report for your final Meyers-Briggs Type.

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Feedback from Others</strong></h3>
Pick a friend from your high school days, one from college and a member of your family. 

Send them your Myers-Briggs Type Results report <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MBTI_Career_Report-Page3.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Summary (page 3)</a>, but tell them they only need to look at page 3, the Summary page. Ask them if they agree with your preferences on the four areas. They may want to look at your clarity scores if the disagree on one of them because they may see you have Slight clarity and that is why they see you differently than you see yourself.
<ul>
</ul>
Also send them a copy of your "Do What You Are" report <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-ENFJ.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Report</a>"target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Description</a> and ask them if they think the first three sections (General Description, Strengths and Weaknesses) are an accurate description of your personality. This report does a good job of putting your Myers-Briggs Type into everyday terms. Tell them they don't need to read the rest of the report. 
<ul>
</ul>
You have now performed a self-assessment and that leads you to the next step.

		<title>Step 5 - Validate Myers-Briggs Type-Personality</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/personality-interests-2/personality/step-4/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You are being asked to spend so much time validating your Myers-Briggs Type because understanding your true personality is one of the most important predictors of a successful career. Doing things that fit with your natural personality will make you much more successful than trying to work against the grain.

As was stated earlier your personality type is the only thing that stays constant through out your adult life. It is important to identify your true personality type right now.

By completing Step 4 you now have a Self Assessment of your Myers-Briggs Type. Hopefully it matches the MBTI that came from the Web based assessment you received.

But you could still be questioning your personality type. It may help to recall what you were thinking or experiencing when you took that Web based assessment. Your results reflect how you "voted" when asked to choose between opposites. What led you to respond as you did? Perhaps, instead of describing yourself as you really are, you were thinking about how someone else wants you to be, or about how you would ideally like to be. Or maybe you were thinking about a career that you wanted and so responded as you thought someone in that field might. Maybe you were getting ready for a major test and were in a hurry.

As you go through the process of discovering your "true" personality type, remember everyone uses all of the eight preferences at different times. Also realize there are individual differences within each type, e.g. INTJ. No one description will fully capture your uniqueness. You are trying to discover which is more natural, which comes easier. That is going to be your true preference. 

In the end of the Do What You Are document there is a section called The Secret to Success. The first sentence says "Understand that using your strengths is easy". Here are two examples from Don to illustrate the concept of natural and easy.
<ul>
</ul>
1)	It has always been easy for me to make decisions based on an objective analysis of the situation and logic. People are always impressed by this, but it is not really a skill, rather a part of my personality. My preference is Thinking (T).
<ul>
</ul>
2)	Taking a planned and organized approach requires no work for me, unlike it does for others. It is second nature because I am obviously wired to take that approach. My preference is Judging (J)
<ul>
</ul>
Richard Branson, the founder/CEO, of Virgin preference is clearly Extroversion. For him to work a crowd is fun and natural. For me that would not be natural, my preference is Introversion. When I am thoroughly prepared and speaking about a subject I know well I feel comfortable in front of a group. So you can use both of your perspectives. But I am more like a Professor, nothing like Richard Branson.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Examine your Insights</strong></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
Look at the two types of insights you gained in the previous Step. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Assessment Worksheet</strong>
See <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-MBTI_SelfAssessment.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Self Assessment</a> as an example.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Outside Feedback</strong>
Analyze what your friends and family told you about your personality. Do they basically agree with your "Do What You Are" report? If they know the Myers-Briggs Type terminology do they agree with your Type?</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Document your "true" Personality Type</strong></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
Now create a document where you provide your logic for what your "true" personality type should be. Here are two examples:
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-ValidateMeyers-BriggsType_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Validated Personality Type</a> She had a conflict between her self assessment and her formal Myers-Briggs assessment. See how she resolved that conflict.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-ValidateMeyers-BriggsType_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Validated Myers-Briggs Type</a> His two assessment were aligned.</li>]]></content:encoded>

	<li><h3><strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/personality-interests-2/personality/">Personality</a></strong></h3>
To see the detail for this exercise click on its name in the Sub Navigation section on the right. In this exercise you will take your Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator to produce a "Do What You Are" assessment. This will help you understand your personality and the occupations most suited to that personality.</li>

</ul>
<li><h3><strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/personality-interests-2/interests-2">Interests</a></strong></h3>
To see the detail for this exercise click on its name in the Sub Navigation section on the right. This exercise combines two assessments:
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Strong Interest Inventory</strong>: The Strong Interest Inventory has been around for over 70 years and helps you see what types of careers and occupations might interest you.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Strong/Myers-Briggs Career Report</strong>: Your combined results on the Strong and MBTI tools are based on two simple assumptions— 1) that you are most likely to be satisfied and productive if you are working at something that interests you (the Strong Interest Inventory) and 2) if that something also fits your personality (your Myers-Briggs Type).</li>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-RightCareeer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> You have now learned a lot about your personality and the situations where you can thrive. Add insights you have gained to this file. You should be able to find a lot of insights, just like Casey did.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are there areas where you personality and your passion intersect? Casey found a lot of these. It is very normal for you to find meaning and have passion for things are a good fit with your personality.

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your personality to fuel you economic engine. 

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> What careers and jobs did you identify? You should have found some in the Do What You Are report.

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> What types of environments most interest you. Your personality will not fit well in every situation - work or outside of work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared your Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator report. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Your Personality Type, e.g. Casey is ENFJ</strong></H3>

<strong>E (Extraversion) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I focus on the outer world of people and activity
<strong>N (Intuition) - Clarity is Slight:</strong> I take in information from patterns and the big picture and focus on future possibilities
<strong>F (Feeling) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I make decisions based on vales and subjective evaluation of people-centered concerns
<strong>J (Judging) - Clarity is Clear:</strong> I like a planned and organized approach, plus I want to have things settled

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Your Insights</strong></H3>

	<li><strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Personality_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Personality Insights</a></strong> You may want to share some highlights from this document

	<li><strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Careers_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Career Insights</a></strong> This is the bottom line document, i.e. what careers and jobs are a good fit for your personality. Make sure you discuss this.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents:</strong> These are the most important documents you will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. These documents must be discussed.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done two exercises and you should have some feel for a realistic exercise schedule by now.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> Most likely you have now settled into a process that works for the two of you, e.g. how you communicate, how you review.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these exercises.</li>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>1) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don@My-Right-Career.com: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®
Career Report, "Do What You Are" Report, Personality Insights, Personality Self Assessment (Excel Spreadsheet) and your Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>2) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on Exercise #2 and then not again until Exercise #4 and #5.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have now validated your Myers-Briggs Type, e.g. Casey decided she was an ENF<strong>J</strong>, even though her self assessment said she was an ENF<strong>P</strong>. So the next step is to analyze what that means from a career viewpoint.

To do that you will use your "Do What You Are" report. It has sections that provide you information about:

	<li>What you need in a career for it to be satisfying</li>

	<li>Some satisfying career fields and jobs for your Myers-Briggs type (examples of careers many people of your Type find satisfying)</li>

	<li>How to use your personality type strengths to conduct a successful job search.</li>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
Your assignment is to create a Career Insight document. Here are two examples:

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Careers_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Career Insights</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-ValidateMeyers-BriggsType_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Validated Myers-Briggs Type</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
If you follow their format you will be able to directly use the information from the "Do What You Are" report.
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to use their format then down load this template. <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Template-Career_Insights.doc"target="_blank"> Career Insights Word template</a>  This is a Word file with the outline for the Career Insights document.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You now have two descriptions of your personality:
<ul>
	<li>Summary of your MBTI Results (page 3): Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MBTI_Career_Report-Page3.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Myers-Briggs Summary</a> to see an example. This provides you with your Type, for example Casey is an ENFJ. It also provides a Clarity score for each of the Preferences, e.g. Casey is Moderate on the Extraversion scale.</li>
	<li>Do What You Are: Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-DoWhatYouAre-TypeDescr.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's "Do What You Are" Description</a> to see an example. This provides a more layman's description of your Personality and your Strengths/Weaknesses, still using your Myers-Briggs Type.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
Create a Personality Insights document using information from your "Do What You Are" report. The Insights document will have the following sections, which mirror the sections in the Do What You Are document. Take a look at <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-Personality_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Personality Insights</a>. It follows the outline below.
<ul>
	<li><strong>General Description:</strong> She took several of the sentences, shown in quotes, from the general description and provided examples from her life to show this statement was accurate. For example:“<strong>Maintaining harmony relationships is a lifelong goal and a natural skill”</strong>
a. I feel like this pertains to me because I have maintained relationships with my friends who I have known since I was five. I also tend to make sure that my friendships with them are going well because I truly value friends as part of my life.
b. As I get older and become an adult, it has become apparent that my new friendships I have formed at college also need to remain harmonious, as well as my relationships with members of my family.</li>
	<li><strong>Work Related Strengths</strong>: She picked some of her top Strengths and did the same thing - provided examples from her life to show this strength was accurate. For example:"<strong>Enthusiasm and ability to enlist cooperation from others"</strong>
a. I always have a lot of passion for things I care about and people like to feed off my energy.
b. This will be helpful in the workplace because I will be able to get people motivated to be the best they can be. This will help the company do better overall and will improve the work environment positively.
c. I am able to make people excited about doing things.</li>
	<li><strong>Work Related Weaknesses</strong>: She picked some of her top Weaknesses and did the same thing - provided examples from her life to show this weakness was accurate. For example:<strong>"Avoidance of conflict and tendency to ignore unpleasantness"</strong>
a. I have a problem where I don’t like to confront people because I truly cherish harmonious relationships.
b. In the work place, I need to make sure I confront people who do not respect me in order to be productive and respected at work.
c. I also need to confront people who are not carrying their weight on projects or doing quality work</li>
	<li><strong>The Secret to Success:</strong> She took the two sub sections of this and addressed them.

1) Understand that using your strengths is easy.

2) The real secret to success for an ENFJ is learning to:

Slow Down:
Relinquish some control:
Take things less personally

<strong>Another Example:</strong> For another example take a look at <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-Personality_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Personality Insights</a>
<h1><strong>Introvert Insights</strong></h1>
Click on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts.html" target="_blank">The Power of Introversion</a> to see Susan Cain's TED talk (20 minutes). It has over 5 million views. Below is a short description:

<strong><em>In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else, it can be difficult, even shameful, to be an introvert. But, as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk, introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world, and should be encouraged and celebrated.</em></strong>

<strong><em>Our world prizes extroverts -- but Susan Cain makes a case for the quiet and contemplative</em></strong>

If you are an Introvert, or an Extrovert who would like to understand the 1/3 to 1/2 the people in the world who are Introverts, you need to watch this video.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Now is time to discuss the results of your first three Assignments: Begin at the End, Look at Self (Personality and Interests) and Look at the Past (Autobiography and Accomplishments), with your Career Advisory Board.
<ul>
</ul>
You should proceed with the next exercise while you are having discussions with your Career Advisory Board members. Due to schedule conflicts it could take several weeks to complete this step and you can be working on the next exercise in parallel.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Key Exercise Output</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
For the Board Members you know would like to have supporting detail to the MyRightCareer Insights you can send them files from each of your five exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography and Accomplishments. Below are Casey's examples.
<ul>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Look at the Past Assignment</strong></h3>

	<li><h5><strong>Autobiography Exercise</strong></h5>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Autobiography Insights</a> You may have integrated your insights into your Top Accomplishments file.</li>

<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h5><strong>Accomplishments Exercise</strong></h5>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h1>

At the minimum you need to send them your five MyRightCareer Insights files from your last  exercise (Accomplishments): Be Your Best, Meaning & Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. You only need to send them the files from your Accomplishments exercise because they are cumulative files and include your insights from the Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography and Accomplishments exercises. 
<ul>
</ul>
For each area, e.g. Be Your Best, you should  have a dialogue about what you have discovered about yourself relative to that element in the Right Career Venn diagram. You should also have a discussion about what you have learned about yourself as a Whole Person, the fifth file.
<ul>
</ul>
Here are Casey's as an example:

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss What is Next for your Career Advisory Board</strong></h1>
Inform them you will be asking for their help again after you finish the next three Assignments: Strengths (Talents/Strengths and Skills), Meaning (Stories, Drivers, How you will Measure Your Life) and Economic Engine (Age 30 & Age 22). Remind them your last review will take place after the Capstone Project, where you will have identified your Right Career (s), developed your Sales Story for that Right Career (s) and created a Follow-on Plan.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 11 - Summary-Personality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Each of us has a distinct personality that stays with us for life. We may change our behavior in certain situations because we wouldn't be able to function successfully if we didn't. But we don't change our natural personality.

In the Right Career Concepts Overview and then again in the Welcome to the Personality Exercise video we saw the difference between the lady who is an Extravert Feeler and the Director of Public Relations and the man who is an Intravert Thinker and the Director of Financial Planning and Analysis. They work for the same small company and are good friends.  

The Director of Public Relations is an Extravert who prefers being around people a lot, a public role and thinking out loud; who has high energy and is outgoing and enthusiastic. As a Feeler she is warm and friendly, diplomatic and tactful and quick to complement others. Her role requires her to be in front of people or on the phone with people all the time. 

The Director of Financial Planning & Analysis is an Intravert who feels comfortable being alone, working "behind-the-scenes" and thinking quietly inside his head; who has quiet energy and is self-contained and reserved. His role requires him to do sophisticated financial analysis and provide business advice to the CFO and CEO.

By leveraging their natural personalities they are both very successful in their jobs and both are very happy in their jobs.

The Director of Financial Planning and Analysis would like to be the CFO of a small company and take the company public. Most likely he will have to be the Investor Relations person for the company until it gets big enough to hire one. This is something he can do - it requires him to switch from Intravert to Extravert - but not something he prefers to do. He is most natural at working inside his head doing financial things. 

The Director of Public Relations would like to be the VP of Marketing at a small company. In that role she knows she will have to create budgets and do a lot more financial work. She can do this - switch from Feeling to Thinking - it is just not her preferred method of operating. Luckily for both of them, as they advance to their higher level roles, they don't have to operate outside of their natural personalities for very much of their time. By staying in roles that leverage their natural personalities they will continue to be successful and happy.

As you saw there are a lot of different careers/jobs that people who share your personality type find satisfying. Casey, who is an ENFJ, was able to pick out 10 careers/jobs she liked and 5 she didn't like. Don, who is an INTJ, was also able to pick out 10 career/jobs he liked and 5 he didn't like. 

This exercise provides you with the first direct input on careers/jobs the could be your Right Career (s). It is a great starting point because you now have one piece of the Venn diagram - the Be Your Best circle - and one element of the circle - your natural personality. You should now know how your natural personality affects your choice of the Right Career. You still need to take into account some other factors:

	<li>Interest: Are you really interested in that Career/Job? The next Assignment (Interests) should provide some more insights on this subject.</li>

	<li>Strengths/Skills: Do you have the natural strengths/skills to do well in that particular Career/Job? Maybe you are an INTJ, which is a good personality for a CFO, but you are not very good at financial analysis. The Strengths/Skills Assignment will help you understand this better.</li>

	<li>Meaning/Passion: Does this Career/Job provide you with meaning and therefore evoke passion? You will explore that in the Meaning/Passion Assignment.</li>

	<li>Economic Engine: Does this Career/Job provide you with enough income (fuel) to support the life style (engine) you feel you need.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
The bottom line is your personality is not going to change as you go through life so don't pick a career that doesn't leverage your personality. You can think of it as a way of eliminating careers as well as a way of picking careers. While you may have to take jobs from time to time that work against the grain of your personality in the long run you won't be happy or successful trying to be someone you aren't.

<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> There are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning &amp; Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Career" and one for "Whole Person". This exercise has added a set of insights to each file. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.

These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises except Economic Engine: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories and Drivers. From these examples you can see how she has added insights with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Review your Strong Interest Inventory report &amp; create an Insights document, 2) Review your Strong/Myers-Briggs report &amp; create your Insights document, 3) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 4) Provide feedback, 5) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator and 6) Become an example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. In total the first four steps will probably take you about 4 hours.

Note: If you are an experienced adult, instead of a student, visit the "Experienced Adult" page before beginning this exercise.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Interest_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Interests Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.

There are two approaches you can take to complete exercises: Short Instructions or Full Instructions. You can also use a hybrid approach in at least two different ways: 1) Use the Short Instructions for one Step and then switch to the Full Instructions on another Step if you need more help or 2) Use the Short Instructions on a Step until you need more help on that Step and then go directly to the Full Instructions on that Step for more instructions.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=2963">Short Instructions Approach</a></strong></h1>
If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically listening to a 5 minute video and using examples to do your work.
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=2965">Full Instructions</a></strong></h1>
If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the same 5 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.]]></content:encoded>

You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

<ul>
</ul>
Used by more than 70 percent of U.S. colleges and universities, the Strong Interest Inventory® assessment is one of the world’s most widely respected and frequently used career planning tools. It helps high school and college students — as well as people in transition — make fulfilling career choices. By giving students insight into their interests, preferences, and personal styles, the Strong enables them to identify specific courses, jobs, internships, and activities they’re likely to enjoy.

On this page are two types of templates you can use. At the top are templates for your analysis and insights. At the bottom of the page is the Interests Checklist which allows you to keep track of the status of the sub-exercises in the Exercise.
<h2><strong>Analysis/Insights Templates</strong></h2>
These are Word files with the outlines for the Insights documents. If you look at the Edward or Casey examples you will see they basically used these same outlines.

<h2><strong>Checklist Template </strong></h2>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Interest_Checklist.xls" target="_blank">Interests Checklist Template</a> you will be able to down the Excel file that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in this exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. Both of you can get the file from this Templates page.
<h2><strong>File Naming</strong></h2>
You should save any file you down load on your computer. Then create another copy with your name appended on the front of that file. You can then fill in your own information in that new file. If you someway screw up that file you can download the template again and not overwrite the one with your data. This way you may be able to copy some of your data from your partly damaged file to the new template.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should watch the Welcome to Interests Exercise video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as they do this exercise:

Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as they do this exercise:
<h4><strong>Strong Interest Inventory</strong></h4>
Remind them that this report is just organizing and putting into categories what they told the assessment program interested them. A lot of what they will see may not necessarily really interest them when presented in that manner and that is OK. Get them to look for just a few good ideas. Encourage them to use <a href="http://www.onetonline.org" target="_blank">O*NET</a>. It currently includes 974 occupations which currently have, or are scheduled to have, data collected from job incumbents or occupation experts.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrongInventory.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Strong Interest Inventory Report (pages 1 - 9)</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrongInventory_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Strong Interest Inventory Insights</a>
<h4><strong>Strong Interest Inventory &amp; Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</strong></h4>
Your combined results on the Strong and MBTI tools are based on the assumption that you are most likely to be satisfied and productive if you are working at something you enjoy in an environment that fits your personality.

<h4><strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h4>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. They will be accumulating their insights about that circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably quite a few weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached.

From the Interests exercise they should get some great insights for the "Be Your Best" file because they will have identified their interests. They will also be receiving their 2nd direct recommendations that can be used in the "Right Careers" file.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have already taken this assessment and received the Strong Interest Inventory and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report (with Strong Profile) Report. The middle part of this report is titled College Profile and it has 4 pages. Here is an example: 

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Casey-StrongCollegeProfile.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's College Profile Report</a>. 
<ul>
</ul>
This report will help you identify college courses and academic majors that allow you to express what is important to you.
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
Take a look at the following areas:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Using your Themes</strong></h4></li>
Your top three themes are listed in order of interest. For example Casey's top three themes are: 
- Enterprising (E): ACTIVE PERSUADERS - Enterprising students prefer to influence or lead others through selling the merits of ideas or products.
- Social (S): EMPATHIC HELPERS - Social students prefer to take a helping or altruistic approach involving teaching, developing, or caring for others.
- Artistic (A): CREATIVE COMMUNICATORS - Artistic students prefer to take a self-expressive or creative approach involving art/design, music, or writing.

Each Theme describes an important aspect of your interests and personality. Use all three Themes to identify college courses and academic majors that allow you to express what is important to you. The majors listed within each Theme are examples of some of the many related academic areas worth exploring.

For example Casey identified, under the Enterprising (E): ACTIVE PERSUADERS Theme, the following majors: Business Admin, Marketing and Public Relations.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Using your Basic Interest Scales</strong></h4></li>

These scales indicate interests that are important to your overall lifestyle, both in school and out of school. Use your strongest basic interests to explore college courses, extracurricular activities, internships, and part-time jobs. 
<ul>
</ul>
The report shows you the five areas in which you showed the greatest interest (arranged in descending order of interest). Then for each area it provides examples of: Campus Organizations/Activities, Internships/Job settings and College Courses that match with those areas.

For Casey her #1 Area was Marketing & Advertising (Marketing, researching and developing advertising campaigns for products and services). It then provided these examples:
- Campus Organizations/Activities: Advertising Club, Business Student Organization
- Internships/Job settings: Advertising company, Company Marketing Department
- College Courses: Business Management, Communications and Marketing
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Using your Occupational Scales</strong></h4></li>

These scales identify jobs held by people with whom you share common interests, arranged in order of similarity of interests. Some occupations require specific training; however, many do not require a particular college major. Explore classes relevant to these occupations and consider related careers as well.

For each occupation, e.g. Advertising Account Manager, the report provides:
- Educational preparation, e.g. BA in liberal arts or business
- College courses, e.g. Marketing, Advertising and Communications
- Related Careers, e.g. Media Manager and Sales Manager
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Using your Professional Styles Scales</strong></h4></li>

Use your Personal Style Scales to identify the specific ways you prefer to approach whatever academic courses, majors, or jobs you undertake.

The report takes each Personal Style and provides guidance for school related activities. As an example for Casey's Work Style which suggests "a preference for working closely or frequently with people rather than working alone" the report provides the following guidance: "You may prefer academic activities that focus on interpersonal interactions, such as study groups, group assignments and helping others, rather than studying and researching on your own."
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Document any insights you have gained from this exercise</strong></h4></li>

 Casey documented her insights in a separate document, organized by the four areas above: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Casey-StrongMBTI.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's College Profile Insights</a>. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
This should have given you some insights into which major to choose or if you have already chosen a major some validation of that choice. It should also provide additional guidance on related courses, campus organizations, internships, etc you can use to further your progress along your path to your Right Career.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have already taken this assessment and received the Strong Interest Inventory and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Career Report (with Strong Profile) Report. The last part of this report is titled Strong and MBTI Career Report. It has 13 pages. Here is an example:

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrongMBTI.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Strong &amp; Myers-Briggs Report</a>

Your combined results on the Strong and MBTI tools are based on the same assumption—that you are most likely to be satisfied and productive if you are working at something you enjoy in an environment you find compatible.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>The <strong>Strong Interest Inventory</strong> matches your interests with six types of work environments.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator</strong> describes your personality type and matches it with types of work.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>

Take a look at the following areas:
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Combined Strong Themes and MBTI Preference</strong></h4>
Review what happens when you take your strongest General Occupation Theme (e.g. Enterprising) and combine that with your MBTI.

	<li>Casey: ENTERPRISING + ENFJ = The <strong>Collaborative Persuaders</strong></li>

	<li>Edward: ENTERPRISING + INTJ = The <strong>Theoretical Persuaders</strong></li>
<ul>
</ul>	
<h4><strong>Combined Personal Style &amp; MBTI Preferences</strong></h4>
Review the results on the five Strong inventory scales that describe your personal style of working and learning, combined with the impact of your MBTI preferences.
	
<h4><strong>Career Fields suggested by your combined results</strong></h4>
Explore the career fields that reflect both General Occupational Theme (e.g. Enterprising) work environments suggested by your Strong results and O*NET™ job families that attract your MBTI type.

One of the five Career Fields that Casey really liked was Public Relations. It is a O*NET job family that attracts ENFJ types (Casey's Myers-Briggs Type). She used the O*NET code (27-3031.00) for that Career Field at the O*NET Web site and this is what she found <a href="http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/27-3031.00" target="_blank">Casey's O*Net Public Relations Report</a>

<strong>Action Steps:</strong> Do you see a pattern in these occupations? Try highlighting any Knowledge, Skills or Abilities or words or phrases that particularly appeal to you. You will probably see some trends emerge.
	
<h4><strong>Occupations suggested by your combined results</strong></h4>
Review the occupations that were suggested by both your Strong and MBTI results, thus making it likely that you may find these occupations satisfying and enjoyable. Keep in mind that:
1) Your interests are similar to those of people working in these occupations who like their work
2) these occupations tend to attract people with your MBTI preferences who are satisfied with their job</li>
	
<h4><strong>Additional Occupations to Explore</strong></h4>
The occupations in the previous step were suggested because they match both your Strong interests and your MBTI preferences. There are many other occupations that may also be a good fit for your combined results, or for just one of the instruments.

<strong>Action Steps:</strong> Take a look at the Action Steps provided at the bottom of this section. They are customized to your Myers-Briggs Type.
	
<h4><strong>Good Match to Start Your Career</strong></h4>
The Strong Interest Inventory and Meyers-Briggs assessment can guide you to a career direction that is interesting and fulfilling. Be sure to consider entry positions that are a good fit for your Strong Theme and MBTI preferences. Look at the questions in the two boxes for some guidance on your first job.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Document any insights you have gained from this exercise</strong></h4>

Casey documented her insights in a separate document, organized by the four areas above: <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrongMBTI_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Strong &amp; Myers-Briggs Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
When you are finished with this you will have insights that combine your interests and your personality with a focus on your personal style of working &amp; learning and suggestions of career and occupations.These reports will help you understand how you can "Be Your Best" and give you some insights into what has "Meaning &amp; Passion" for you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-RightCareeer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> You have now identified a lot of your interests, some of them are related to your natural personality and strengths. Add insights you have gained to this file. You should be able to find a lot of insights, just like Casey did.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are there areas where you interests and your passion intersect? Casey found a lot of these. It is very normal for you to find meaning and have passion for things that interest you.

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your interests to fuel you economic engine. Do you see how your interests may cause you to require more fuel.

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> What careers and jobs did you identify? You should have found some in the Strong Interest Inventory report and some more in the Strong and Myers-Briggs report.

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> What types of environments most interest you. The Strong Theme & Myers-Briggs Type provides some good clues on your preferred work environment. The Strong Personal Style & Myers-Briggs Preferences provides insights on how you like to work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared your Strong Interest Inventory report. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Strong Interest Inventory Report & O*NET System:</strong> Share the key findings from the Strong Inventory Report and the key findings from the O*NET Interests exercise.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Strong Interest Inventory Insights:</strong> You should have a lot of ideas from both the Strong Interest Inventory report and the O*NET system.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Strong and Myers-Briggs Report:</strong> Share the key findings from the Strong and Myers-Briggs Report. You may want to highlight what you learned by combining Interests and Personality.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Strong and Myers-Briggs Insights:</strong> This should be a very useful discussion because it builds on what you learned about yourself in the Personality exercise.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents::</strong> These are the most important documents you will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. These documents must be discussed.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done three exercises and you should have a handle on the schedule by now.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> Most likely you have now settled into a process that works for the two of you, e.g. how you communicate, how you review.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these exercises.</li>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the same process we used in the previous exercises.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: Strong Interest Inventory® and
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® Career Report, O*NET Career List, O*NET Interest Profiler: Score Report (you had to print this to a pdf when you took it), O*NET Interest Profiler: Career List, a career description that interests you (you can provide more than one) and your Insights document.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>C) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on Exercise #2 and then not again until Exercise #4 and #5.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You looked at two different reports which each provided different insights into possible Right Careers.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Strong Interest Inventory</strong></h1>
The Strong Interest Inventory® instrument is a powerful tool that can help you make satisfying decisions about your career and education. Understanding your Strong Interest Profile can help you identify a career focus and begin your career planning and exploration process. Keep in mind that the Strong measures interests, not skills or abilities, and that the results can help guide you toward rewarding careers, work activities, education programs, and leisure activities—all based on your interests.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Strong & Myers-Briggs</strong></h1>
This report builds on what you have learned from prior interpretations of the Strong and MBTI tools. Your results on the Strong and MBTI tools are based on the same assumption—that you are most likely to be satisfied and productive if you are working at something you enjoy in an environment you find compatible.

<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> There are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Career" and one for "Whole Person". This exercise has added a set of insights to each file. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

<h3><strong>Bud</strong></h3>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills-Occupations-List.pdf" target="_blank">Occupations List</a> The O*NET system then produced a list of Occupations that use those skills. The list starts with the occupations that use the most of his skills and then goes down. Bud highlighted in yellow the occupations of most interest to him.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-Matched.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Skills Required vs. Bud's Skills</a> The O*NET System produces a report showing the skills required for the CEO role and then shows which of those Bud has. There is a similar report for the Treasurer-Controller role. One of the skills Bud lacks for both roles is Active Listening.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Summary Report</a> The O*NET System has a comprehensive report for each Occupation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you need to review the MyRightCareer Insights files you have created in all of the other Exercises: Be Your Best, Meaning & Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. Second you need to identify your Right Career from those insights and any other sources of inspiration. Include some of the insights from the MyRightCareer Insights files to justify your Right Career (s) choice.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Review Your MyRightCareer Insights Files</strong></h1>
You need to review the MyRightCareer Insights files you have been adding to with each exercise. For example here are Casey's MyRightCareer Insight's files: 
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey' "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-MyRC-RightCareeer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Don-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Economic.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Identify Your Right Career (s)</strong></h1>
You need to Identify your Right Career (s) and then provide some of the Supporting Insights that led you to that conclusion.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Identify your Right Career (s)</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on Casey's Right Career Elevator Statement:

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
You will see she has identified her Right Career as: 

	<li><strong>Function</strong>: Director of Marketing and Public Relations</li>
	<li><strong>Industry</strong>: Apparel, specifically consignment/vintage stores</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong>: Major Cities, e.g. Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Supporting Insights</strong></h2>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Supporting Insights (10 Pages)</a>.
<ul>
</ul>
You will notice she has taken insights from a lot of the Exercises to support her choice of her Right Career, e.g. 

<h5><strong>Be My Best</strong></h5>
My official Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment is an ENFJ
My Work Related Strengths related to my MBTI
What I need to do in order for a career to be satisfying 
General Occupational Themes Insights: Top 3 - •	Enterprising, Social & Artistic
Natural Talents/Strengths: Includer, Empathy & Restorative
Skills Insights: People Skills & Information Skills

<h5><strong>Meaning & Passion</strong></h5>
Helping Others: recognize and cultivate the potential in others. 
Working in Teams: Intrigued with the unique qualities of each person. I have a gift for figuring out how people who are different can work together productively
Meaning at Work: I need to make sure that I have personal growth in my career and that I feel like I am making a contribution to my company and even to the world. I make a deep commitment to work in which I really believe.
Friendships: These are very important to me, at work and outside work.

<h5><strong>Economic Engine</strong></h5>
So I will need to choose something that leverages my natural strengths & personality, but also has a high income potential. I do know from doing the budget exercises those career (s) should not be heavy on analysis and budget work.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Whole Person</strong></h5>
Work Related: I have always been interested in fashion for very little money. 
Personal Related – These are my Age 30 Vision: Family: married, children, extended family. Other: NYC (or other large city), health, friends
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Create Marketing Summaries</strong></h2>
You should create a couple of summaries you can use in your marketing effort and when talking to people.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Short Summary</strong></h5>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Summary (2 Pages)</a>.

Casey's Insights document is over 10 pages long and includes all of her insights from all of the Exercises. In this short summary she got those insights down to only two pages, a more workable size.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Elevator Statement</strong></h5>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a>.

This document reduces it down to less than one page. It is called an Elevator Statement because you want something short enough to answer the question "Casey, what do you want to do when you get out of college?", in the time it takes to go a few floors in an elevator. You should pause after the first paragraph (where you tell them your choice of career) and ask "Would you like to know why I chose that as a career?" If they say Yes, you can continue with the insights you gained that led to that choice.

		<title>Step 3 - Sales Story</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have three tasks to complete in this step. First you need to review the Right Career files you created in Step 1: Right Career - Supporting Insights, Right Career - Summary and Right Career - Elevator Statement. Second you need to create your Sales Story from those files and any other sources of inspiration. Third you need to decide how you are going to use this Sales Story in your marketing efforts.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Review Your Right Career Choice Files</strong></h1>
Below are the three files Casey created to describe her Right Career:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Supporting Insights (10 Pages)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Summary (2 Pages)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Create your Sales Story</strong></h1>
It is suggested you create two versions of your Sales Story - a full version (greater than one page) and an Elevator Version (less than one page)
<h5><strong>Full Sales Story (2 pages)</strong></H5>
Casey first created the two page version of her Sales Story, using the Right Career Summary (2 pages) as the starting point:
<ul>
</ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Sales_Story.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Sales Story (2 pages)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
You will notice the Sales Story (2 pages) file and the Right Career (2 pages) files are very similar. They both contain the basic same information because the career that is right for you is also the one in which you will most likely be successful. The Sales Story (2 pages) version is written in a more pro active voice.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Elevator Sales Story (less than 1 page)</strong></H5>
Casey created her Sales Story - Elevator Statement (3/4 page), using the Right Career - Elevator Statement Summary (3/4) as the starting point:
<ul>
</ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Sales_Story-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Sales Story - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Use your Sales Story in your Marketing</strong></h1>
There are multiple uses for your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Marketing Material</strong></H5>
You can take a subset of the Sales Story and use it on your resume and your LinkedIn Profile.
<ul>
</ul>
<h5><strong>In Person Marketing</strong></H5>
You can also start using it when talking to people about your career. You can use the Elevator version of the Sales Story as the starting point. I suggest you do it in multiple steps:

<strong>Step 1: Explain your goal:</strong> "Director of Marketing and Public Relations who is in charge of managing different consignment/vintage stores in major cities".
 <ul>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2: Pause and see their reaction to that statement.</strong> I think it will be one of the two below, and maybe both.
	<li>Why is that right for you? You can use your Right Career - Elevator Statement, which explains why this is the right career for you.</li>

	<li>Why are you right for that job? You can use the Sales Story - Elevator Statement to explain why you will be a success in that career.</li>

	<li>Note: you will notice they both contain the basic same information because the career that is right for you means you will be successful in that career.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Step 3: Ask for his help.</strong> You should stress you spent a lot of time to reach this conclusion and are convinced this is the correct answer. But you want to test it via an Internship and get experience. Does he know how you can get experience in one or both of the areas in your Right Career, e.g. for Casey:
	<li>Marketing and Public Relations (could be in another related industry)</li>
	<li>Consignment/vintage stores (any fashion industry internship)</li>
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you need to review your Right Career (s) you identified in Step 1 and the Sales Story you created in Step 2. Second you need to create a Follow-on Plan, i.e. now that you have identified your Right Career what are you going to do next to leverage that into a job in that area.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Review Your Right Career and Your Sales Story</strong></h1>
Below are Casey's examples:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Sales_Story-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Sales Story - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Create Your Follow-on Plan</strong></h1>
Now that you know your Right Career (s) what are you going to do next. Casey's plan is almost 2 years long, while Edwards is only 1 year long. You can create a Follow-on Plan that fits your situation.
<ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Analysis/Insights Templates</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Ideas for Action Insights</strong></h4>

If you still have not settled on your Right Career (s) you have several options for estimating your Income: 1) You can assume you don't know the precise career, but you have some idea of the wage range (e.g. $80,000/year by Age 30) or 2) You can work backwards to determine how much income is required to support the life style you desire (e.g. what is the minimum income you need to have a decent life). Edward is assuming that his career will provide him with $100,000/year of income by Age 30.

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2) Your Age 22 Budget</strong></h3>
Develop an Income and Expense budget for your first job out of college. As with the Age 30 Budget you have several options for estimating your Income: 1) You can assume you are starting at one of your Right Careers, i.e. you have gotten a professional job you wanted and you know the wage range, 2) You can assume you don't know the precise job you will end up getting, but you have some idea of the wage range (e.g. $40,000/year) or 3) You can work backwards to determine how much income is required to support the life style you desire (e.g. what is the minimum income you need to have a decent life). Edward is assuming that his first job out of college will provide him with $40,000/year of income.

<strong>Estimate Your Age 22 Budget</strong>
Example (pdf): <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Don-Budget-Age-22-Prof.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 22 Budget</a>
Template (Excel): You can use the Age 30 Budget you just created in Step 1 as the starting point for your Age 22 Budget. Make a copy of the Age 30 Budget and change the name to Age 22. Then change your salary, taxes, expenses, etc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Economic Engine Approach</strong></h1>
The third circle in the Right Career Venn diagram is Fuel Your Economic Engine. You will discover there is almost nothing in life that does't have a financial dimension to it, even deciding to get married or have children, two of the most personal decisions in life. You can find a career at which you can Be your Best because it leverages your Strengths, Skills and Personality. That same career may have enormous Meaning to you and you work with great Passion. But if society doesn't value that career enough to Fuel Your Economic Engine it probably is not your Right Career. If it doesn't pay you enough to support your family in a reasonable manner it is probably not your Right Career. You get to decide what is reasonable. This exercise will give you some tools to size the economic impact of your life style choices and your career choices. 
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
On this page are three types of templates you can use. At the top are templates for your Budget and your Budget Insights. At the bottom of the page is the Checklist which allows you to keep track of the status of the sub-exercises in the Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Budget Templates</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>
Clicking on the links below will produce an Excel file you can use for your Budget:
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Age 30:</strong> <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Template-Budget-Age-30.xls"target="_blank">Template Age 30 Budget</a>. This is Edward's Age 30 Budget. You should change the file name to YourName-Budget-Age-30. Then either zero out Edward's numbers or replace them with your own.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Age 22:</strong> Use your Age 30 Budget as the Age 22 Template. Make a copy of your Age 30 Budget and change the name to Age 22.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Age 22 Non-Professional:</strong> Use your Age 22 Budget as the Age 22 Non-Professional Template. Make a copy of your Age 22 Budget and change the name to Age 22 Non-Professional.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Budget Insights Templates</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>
Clicking on the links below will produce a Word file you can use for your Insights:
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Age 30:<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-30-Insights.docx"target="_blank"> Edward's Age 30 Budget - Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Age 22:</strong> <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-22-Prof-Insights.docx"target="_blank">Edward's Age 22 Budget - Insights</a>
<ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Checklist Template </strong></h2>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Economic-Engine_Checklist.xls"target="_blank">Economic Engine Checklist Template</a> you will be able to down the Excel file that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in this exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. Both of you can get the file from this Templates page.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>File Naming</strong></h2>
You should save any file you down load on your computer. Then create another copy with your name appended on the front of that file. You can then fill in your own information in that new file. If you someway screw up that file you can download the template again and not overwrite the one with your data. This way you may be able to copy some of your data from your partly damaged file to the new template.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you must make financial estimates, using the Excel Model, for your life at Age 30. Second you need to write your Insights for this Step.

Click on the Excel Model Description in the Sub Navigation menu on the right, it contains most of the general instructions you will need to complete this exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 30 Vision Statement</strong></h1>

<h4><strong>Age 30 Vision Pre-Requisite</strong></h4>

To complete this step you should have your Age 30 Vision statement from the Begin at the End Exercise. If you did not complete the Begin at the End Exercise you have three choices:
	<li>Go back and complete the entire Begin at the End Exercise</li>

	<li>Go back and complete "Step 1 - Age 30 Vision"</li>

	<li>Make up your own Age 30 Vision as you develop your Age 30 Budget</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Age 30 Vision --> Budget</strong></h4>

You should use your Age 30 Vision statement you developed in the first exercise as the starting point for this exercise. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 30 Vision</a> to see his view of his life at Age 30.

Most likely you addressed Whole Person Parameters such as: location (e.g. LA or NYC), living situation (e.g. apartment vs. house), single vs. married, with or without kids, health, fun (e.g. vacations, eating out), family, commute, cars and financials (e.g. “Good Paying” job). You may have even visualized some possible careers.

You are now adding dollars to the words you wrote in that document. For example Don wants to live in Manhattan Beach, one of the really nice beach towns in Los Angeles. Now he needs to estimate his lodging expenses. He is married and they both work hard and play hard. They eat out often and go to comedy clubs. He needs to estimate these entertainment expenses. Skiing has become a passion for both of them and besides driving to ski at Mammoth, the preferred LA ski area, they have started to fly to Colorado and Utah to ski. Hiking the Inca Trail was their first exotic vacations and they want to do more of that. He needs to estimate his Vacation budget.

They would like to buy a home by the beach. There is an Optional exercise for this issue. In four years his wife will be at the age where they will have to decide about having a family. There is an Optional exercises for this exercise. These two are major financial decisions, besides emotional ones.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 30 Budget - Examples & Instructions</strong></h1>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-30.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 30 Budget</a> to see the example used in this exercise. 
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-Budget-Age-30.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Age 30 Budget</a> to see another example.

<h4><strong>Income & Taxes Worksheet</strong></h4>

Sub items: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K) and Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Income</strong>: In the monthly column enter your Wages, Interest Income, Investment Income (e.g. Dividends, Capital Gains, Business Income) and Misc Income. Do the same for your Spouse. 

By now you may have an idea of your Right Career (s) and if so you can use that to estimate your income. If you still have not settled on your Right Career (s) you have several options for estimating your Income: 1) You can assume you don't know the precise career, but you have some idea of the wage range (e.g. $80,000/year by Age 30) or 2) You can work backwards to determine how much income is required to support the life style you desire (e.g. what is the minimum income you need to have a decent life). 

Edward believes he will have a job with a $100,000/year income by Age 30 and his Spouse will be making $40,000 that same year. 

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Salary-Fin-Analyst-IV_LA.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Salary Estimate</a> to see a pdf showing the inputs and outputs for Don at Age 30. You will notice he chose Los Angeles and Financial Analyst. If you want to use the same Web site to estimate your salary click on 

<a href="http://www.homefair.com/real-estate/salary-calculator.asp" target="_blank">Salary by Job Type</a>. You can then enter your job type and your location.

Excel will calculate the totals for each of you and the total for the family. It will also calculate what % each of you is contributing to the total family income, e.g. in Edward's example he contributes about 70% and his spouse contributes about 30%. 
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Before Tax Savings:</strong> Enter the amount of dollars you plan to contribute to your 401K (or Keogh Plan if you are going to be self-employed). For example you can decide that by age 30 you want to contribute 10% of your income/year into your company’s 401K (some companies will match your contribution). Excel will calculate the totals for each of you and the total for the family.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Federal, Social Security and Medicare:</strong> Click on <a href="http://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html"target="_blank">Take Home Pay Calculator</a> and it will assist you in estimating your taxes. Choose monthly Pay Frequency. Pick your filing status (either Single or Married filing jointly). Enter the # of Federal Tax Allowances (e.g. if you are married without children it is 2). Enter the 401K amount/month you chose in the Before Tax Savings section. Then enter the Gross Income you already estimated, if filing as Married you enter the total of your two incomes. If you are filing as single you only enter your income. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Age-22-Prof-Take-Home-Pay-Calculator.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Take-Home_Pay</a> to see a pdf of Edward's inputs and outputs using the Web site.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>State Income Tax:</strong> If your state has an income tax, e.g. California does, Click on <a href="http://www.tax-rates.org/taxtables/income-tax-by-state"target="_blank">Income Tax by State</a> to access the Web site. You need to enter: Filing Status (e.g. single or married), Total Income (use the same yearly income you used in the Federal Tax calculation above), Deductions (select the “Use Federal and State Standard Deductions), Dependents (e.g. Single = 1 and Married = 2). Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Taxes-Age-30-CA-Inc-Tax.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's California Tax</a> to see a pdf of Edward's inputs and outputs using the Web site.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Data Entry:</strong> the Web sites provide your tax as an annual amount. You should enter it as $Tax/12 (e.g. $1,000 = $12,000/12 in the monthly field and you will see the $12,000 appear in the Yearly field). 
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Spendable Income:</strong> Excel will calculate this for you by subtracting your “Before Tax Savings” (e.g. 401K contribution) and your Income Taxes from your Gross Income. This is the amount of money in your pay check each pay period. You have to learn to live on your Take Home Pay. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Hourly Income Worksheet</strong></h4>

This Worksheet is mainly used for the Age 22-NonProfessional exercise. For example you may believe you can earn $20,000/year ($1,667/month) and will figure out later what job (s) would allow you to earn $1,667/month. What you want to find out is “how can I live on $20,000/year”. For the Age 30 model you are probably not getting paid hourly and can just input your monthly salary into the Income &amp; Taxes Worksheet.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Lodging Worksheet</strong></h4>

Sub items: Apartment rent or Mortgage payment, Homeowner Insurance or Renter Insurance and Homeowner Property Tax.

	<li><strong>Owning a House:</strong> Edward visualizes himself owning a house by age 30.He has assumed it is $375,000 with a $75,000 (20%) Down Payment.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> At an early age the most important parameter is how much Down Payment you can make.Most lending organizations require 20% down.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
In the Assumptions section of the Lodging Worksheet there are two sections: Own Your House/Condo or Rent an Apartment. You will use only one of those sections.

In this example Edward has used the Own Your House/Condo section. By using the Web tools from the Web site page, Edward was able to calculate that he could afford to buy a $375,000 house, with a $75,000 downpayment. If you want to see how he did that click on 

<h4><strong>Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4>

<strong>Sub items</strong>: Vacation, Improvements, Food, Fun, Financial Expense, Self, Spouse, Post Tax Savings and Gifts.

Edward estimated the Discretionary Expenses he expects to implement his Age 30 Vision. Of special note is his assumption for Post Tax Savings. Because owning a house is a key element of his Age 30 Vision he has been saving 10% of his salary for a down payment since he started working.

<h4><strong>Non-Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4>

<strong>Sub items:</strong> Household, Medical, Personal Insurance, Pets, Transportation, Utilities, Debt Payments and Miscellaneous.

Edward estimated the Discretionary Expenses he expects to implement his Age 30 Vision. He has assumed both he and his spouse will have cars because they will live in Manhattan Beach and Southern California is a car culture.

<h4><strong>Summary Worksheet</strong></h4>

<strong>Sub items</strong>: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K), Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income. Total Expenses (Discretionary Expenses, Non-Discretionary Expenses and Lodging). Surplus or Shortage

The key focus item is at the bottom of this Worksheet – Surplus/Shortage. Edward's final pass produced a surplus (a positive number). But he had to make multiple changes in his Discretionary and Non-Discretionary Expense to get that line to not be negative.

<h5><strong>DO NOT input any data into the "Income and Expenses - Summary" Worksheet. Excel sources that data from all the other Worksheets, e.g. Income &amp; Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses</strong></h5>

If you want to change any data, e.g. Wages or  Vacation Expense you must go to the appropriate Worksheet and make those changes. The Summary worksheet line items are also summaries of several line items in the detail Worksheets, e.g. Vacation is not a single number, rather it is the following entries: Major Trips, Weekend Trips and Relative Visits. If you want to increase or decrease your Vacation expense you will have to make those changes in one or more of those three sub-categories.

There are multiple uses for the Summary worksheet:

	<li><strong>Surplus/Shortage:</strong> Validate you have created a budget that has a Surplus, rather than a shortage. Most likely your first pass at your budget will create a shortage, i.e. you will have spent more than your "Spendable Income". As you lower your expenses you will keep coming back to the Summary worksheet to see if you have gotten to a positive Surplus/Shortage number.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Spendable Income:</strong> Provide a high level summary of your Spendable Income. You can see, at a summary level, your Gross Income, Before Tax Savings, Taxes and Spendable Income. This may motivate you to increase or decrease your Before Tax Savings. You may be motivated to look for Professionals who could help you to lower your Taxes as a % of Income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Provide a high level summary of your Expenses. You can view them in their three major categories: Lodging, Non-Discretionary and Discretionary. You can view them as a % of your Spendable Income, another effective way to view the expenses. You can quickly identify the top 3 expenses in Non-Discretionary and Discretionary expenses. At the summary level you may see some of the expenses are too low or too high relative to other expenses. </li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>What If:</strong> You can use the Summary worksheet to see the results of changing various aspects of your budget to see "What would happen if". You could test how much income you would need to support the expense level you want (just remember to revisit the Income Taxes Web sites as you increase your Income). At some Income level you will have enough to create a Surplus. You can then decide if that is a reasonable Income. You could do something similar with Expenses, e.g. what is the Income you would need to support the minimum Expenses you require. This is similar to the Age 22 Non-Professional exercise, e.g. what if you could only make $20,000 - can you come up with a reasonable set of expense assumptions to live at that Income level.</li>
<ul>
</ul>

<em>Getting the budget to have a surplus, i.e. spending less than we make, is a real challenge. It took several passes to get it to zero. I would like to spend more on Discretionary, e.g. Vacations, Fun and Personal (my wife and I).

It is really hard to believe that a couple making $140,000 still has to be careful about what they spend. And it is only going to get worse as we have kids. It gives me a new appreciation for my parents.</em>

		<title>Step 4 - Optional:  Financials of Buying a House</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/fuel-economic-engine/step-2-workwards/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></H1>
This is an exploration of Edward buying a house the year after he turns 30. It is based on his long-range plan and makes the same assumptions, i.e. 

	<li>Personal – He starts living with his future wife at 28 & they get married when he is 30.</li>
	<li>Financial – He makes $40,000/year in his 1st job and by age 30 he makes $100,000/year.</li>
	<li>His wife, who is 3 years younger than him, is making $40,000/year when he turns 30.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>House Financials</strong></H1> 
<h3><strong>House Affordability</strong></H3>
The bank would probably not take into account his wife’s income because they are concerned she will quit working when they have kids. Thus he only used his $100,000/year salary for this analysis. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Age-30-House-Affordability-Calculator.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's House Affordability Calculator Results</a> to see his results from using the following parameters: (Annual Income: $100,000; Loan Term: 30 years; Interest Rate: 6%; Down Payment: 20%). Notice the model provides two possible scenarios:

<strong>Acceptable – Debt to Income of 36%</strong>

Mortgage:		$396,000
House Price:		$496,000
Down Payment:	$100,000
Monthly Payment:	$   2,400

<strong>Safe – Debt to Income of 28%</strong>

Mortgage:		$310,000
House Price:		$385,000
Down Payment:	$  75,000
Monthly Payment:	$   1,850
<ul>
</ul>
It is clear they will have to save a lot of money for a down payment if they are going to buy a house after he turns 30. He has assumed they can not save more than $75,000 for a down payment. This means they can not afford more than a $375,000 house. To save that much down payment he will need to save 10% of his income every year from college on and his wife will need to save 10% of her income in the 2-year period they are living together. The down payment is driving the price of the house they can buy, not his income.
<ul>
</ul>
He could buy the almost $500,000 house if they could:
	<li>Make the $100,000 downpayment (maybe parents provide part of downpayment)</li>
	<li>Pay a higher monthly mortgage payment ($2,400 vs. $1,850)</li>
	<li>Pay a higher yearly property tax payment ($7,450 vs. $5,800)</li>
<ul>
</ul>
Often this is referred to as house poor, i.e. the cost of buying and paying for your house has used up all of your financial resources. You may not even have enough left to decorate the house.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Monthly Payments</strong></H3>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Age-30-Mortgage-Calculator.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Mortgage Calculator Results</a> to see the monthly payments for the house he decided to buy. You will notice the Web site provides: mortgage payment, property tax and property insurance. Don then used these in his Age 30 Budget.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Insights</strong></H3>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Buy-a-House_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Buying a House - Insights</a> to see the Insights Edward got from this exercise. Two of the key Insights are:

<em>I never realized how much the Down Payment would influence the price of the house I could purchase. The House Affordability Calculator was a very useful resource to understand the relationship between my income, the down payment, the mortgage payments and the property tax.

I decided to go for the Safe Debt to Income ratio of 28%, limiting the price of the house to $375,000. But I bet when we start looking for houses we will find we don’t like any of the $375,000 houses we find. I already know the typical house price in Manhattan Beach, where I initially wanted to live, is $1M. </em>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Buy a House Exercise</strong></H1>
<h3><strong>House Affordability</strong></H3>
On the Web Sites - Economics page there is a section describing the Loan tools you can use. With the House Affordability Calculator figure out the two houses you can afford. Look at the analysis Edward did that is described above for guidance.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Monthly Payments</strong></H3>
On the Web Sites - Economics page, in the Loan Tools, is the Mortgage Calculator. Use this to determine the monthly payments for the loan you selected. Look at the analysis Edward did that is described above for guidance.
<ul>

In “Step 2 – Work Backwards” you determined your relationship status when you are 26, e.g. Don is single at that age. You decided on your Income at Age 26, e.g. Don’s is $70,000. If you want to own a house by Age 30 or soon after that you determined how much money you need to save each year, e.g. Don is saving 10% of his income, to have enough money to purchase a house in the future (Don needs $75,000 for his down payment).

	<li><h4><strong>Income & Taxes Worksheet</strong><h4/></li>
o	Sub items: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K) and Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income.
o	Your Income: From ‘Step 2 – Work Backwards’ Don believes he will have a job with a $70,000/year income by Age 26. 
o	Spouse’s Income: From ‘Step 2 – Work Backwards’, for example Don believes he will still be single at Age 26, thus there is no Spouse Income.
	<li><h4><strong>Lodging Worksheet</strong><h4/></li>
o	Sub items: 
•	Renter: Apartment rent and Renter Insurance.
•	Home Owner: Mortgage payment, Homeowner Insurance and Homeowner Property Tax.
o	Don visualizes himself living in a nice apartment with two other people. So he only has to pay 1/3 of the rent.
	<li><h4><strong>Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong><h4/></li>
o	Sub items: Vacation, Improvements, Food, Fun, Financial Expense, Self, Spouse, Post Tax Savings and Gifts.
o	Don estimated the Discretionary Expenses he expects he hopes to spend at Age 26. 
o	Don is saving 10% of his income, to have enough money to purchase a house in the future (Don needs $75,000 for his down payment).
	<li><h4><strong>Non-Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong><h4/></li>
o	Sub items: Household, Medical, Personal Insurance, Pets, Transportation, Utilities, Debt Payments, and Miscellaneous.

	<li><h4><strong>Summary Worksheet</strong><h4/></li>
o	The key focus item is at the bottom of this Worksheet – Surplus/Shortage.
o	Don’s final pass produced a surplus (a positive number).
o	But he had to make multiple changes in his Discretionary and Non-Discretionary Expense to get that line to not be negative.

<h1><strong>Your Financial Model</strong></H1>
Make a copy of your Age 30 Budget, from Step 1, and save it as Your Name-Budget Age 26. Click on Excel Model Description to get a pdf document with instructions for each element in the Excel Model, or maybe you remember how to use the Excel Model from doing your Age 30 Financial Model.

First enter your Income numbers, decide on Pre Tax Savings and calculate your Taxes. This will produce your Spendable Income. Second take a look at your Surplus/Shortage number, which will be negative because you have less Spendable Income. Third start through your three categories of expenses (Lodging, Discretionary and Non-Discretionary) looking for places to cut expense.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you must create a budget, using the basic same Excel Model you used for your Age 30 budget, for your life at Age 22 (your first year out of college). Second you need to write your Insights for this Step.

Click on the Excel Model Description in the Sub Navigation menu on the right, it contains most of the general instructions you will need to complete this exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 22 Status</strong></h1>
You need to determine your relationship status when you are 22, e.g. Don is single and having fun dating.
<ul>
</ul>
You need to determine your work status. In this exercise you have several options: 1) You can assume you are starting at one of your Right Careers, i.e. you have gotten a professional job you wanted and you know the wage range, 2) You can assume you don't know the precise job you will end up getting, but you have some idea of the wage range (e.g. $40,000/year) or 3) You can work backwards to determine how much income is required to support the life style you desire (e.g. what is the minimum income you need to have a decent life). Don is assuming that his first job out of college will provide him with $40,000/year of income.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 22 Budget - Example & Instructions</strong></h1>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-22-Prof.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 22 Budget</a> to see the example used in this exercise. 
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Casey-Budget-Age-22.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Age 22 Budget</a> to see another example.

<h4><strong>Income &amp; Taxes</strong></h4>

Sub items: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K) and Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income.

	<li><strong>Spouse #1 Income:</strong>Edward believes he will start out earning 40,000/year </li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Spouse #2 Income:</strong> Since Edward assumes he is single at Age 22 there is no Spouse #2 Income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Hourly Income</strong></h4>

Again this Worksheet is mainly used for the Age 22-NonProfessional exercise. For example you may believe you can earn $20,000/year ($1,667/month) and will figure out later what job (s) would allow you to earn $1,667/month. What you want to find out is “how can I live on $20,000/year”. For the Age 30 model you are probably not getting paid hourly and can just input your monthly salary into the Income &amp; Taxes Worksheet.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Lodging Worksheet</strong></h4>

Sub items: Apartment rent or Mortgage payment, Homeowner Insurance or Renter Insurance and Homeowner Property Tax.

In the Assumptions section of the Lodging Worksheet there are two sections: Own Your House/Condo or Rent an Apartment. You will use only one of those sections.

In this example Edward has used the "Rent an Apartment" option. He has assumed there will be 3 people living in this apartment and thus calculated the monthly rent and renter's insurance by dividing the total by 3.

<h4><strong>Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4>

<strong>Sub items</strong>: Vacation, Improvements, Food, Fun, Financial Expense, Self, Spouse, Post Tax Savings and Gifts.

Edward estimated the Discretionary Expenses he expects to spend. Of special note is his assumption for Post Tax Savings. Because owning a house is a key element of his Age 30 Vision he has been saving 10% of his salary for a down payment since he started working. You will notice he is spending a lot less at a $40,000 salary then he is able to spend at a combined $140,000 income when he is married and Age 30.

<h4><strong>Non-Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4>

<strong>Sub items:</strong> Household, Medical, Personal Insurance, Pets, Transportation, Utilities, Debt Payments and Miscellaneous.

Edward estimated the Discretionary Expenses he expects. He has assumed he will have a car because Southern California is a car culture.

<h4><strong>Summary Worksheet</strong></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Warning</strong></h3>

<h5><strong>DO NOT input any data into the "Income and Expenses - Summary" Worksheet. Excel sources that data from all the other Worksheets, e.g. Income &amp; Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses</strong></h5>

If you want to change any data, e.g. Wages or  Vacation Expense you must go to the appropriate Worksheet and make those changes. The Summary worksheet line items are also summaries of several line items in the detail Worksheets, e.g. Vacation is not a single number, rather it is the following entries: Major Trips, Weekend Trips and Relative Visits. If you want to increase or decrease your Vacation expense you will have to make those changes in one or more of those three sub-categories.

The key focus item is at the bottom of this Worksheet – Surplus/Shortage. Edward"s final pass produced a surplus (a positive number). But he had to make multiple changes in his Discretionary and Non-Discretionary Expense to get that line to not be negative.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 22 Budget Insights</strong></h1>

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-22-Prof-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 22 Budget - Insights</a> to see an example. Edward's summary paragraph in his Insights document was:

<em>Getting the budget to have a surplus, i.e. spending less than I make, was a real challenge again. My income fell from $140,000 (Age 30 - 2 wage earners) to $40,000 (single & first job out of college). I had to cut out a significant amount of the expenses I had in my Age 30 Budget. While $40,000 is a lot more money than I have been making in college it is amazing how little it seems when doing this exercise.</em>

<h1><strong>Your Age 22 Budget Model</strong></h1>
Make a copy of your own Budget Age 30 Excel file and change its name to YourName-Budget Age 22. You can then change the numbers in your Budget Age 30 file to reflect your life at Age 22, e.g. Income, Lodging, Expenses. 

Click on Excel Model Description in the Sub-Navigation Menu on the right to get a pdf document with instructions for each element in the Excel Model. You should have a good understanding of how the Excel model works from creating your Age 30 Budget.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
This exercise will help you understand your financial situation if you are not able to get a professional job right out of college. Even if you strongly believe you will get a professional job, this exercise will give you an idea of your financial reality if you don’t. Or you may get an internship in your profession, but it pays a lot less than a full position (e.g. maybe $20,000 versus $40,000).
<ul>
</ul>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you must create a Budget, using the Excel Model, for your life at Age 22, assuming you are not able to get a professional job right out of college. Second you need to write your Insights for this Step.
<ul>
</ul>
We will continue to use Edward as our example.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 22 Status</strong></h1>
You need to determine your relationship status when you are 22, e.g. Edward is single and having fun dating.
<ul>
</ul>
You need to determine your work status. For example Edward was not able to get a job in his chosen financial analysis Career. He is working three jobs: a waiter, a bike shop salesman and a high school math tutor. He is still pursuing his target career.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Age 22 Non-Professional Job Budget</strong></h1>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Budget-Age-22-NonProf.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Age 22 Budget - Non-Professional Job</a> to see his Budget.

<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Hourly Income</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
</ul>
This Worksheet is mainly used for the Age 22-NonProfessional exercise. For example you may believe you can earn $20,000/year ($1,667/month) and will figure out later what job (s) would allow you to earn $1,667/month. What you want to find out is “how can I live on $20,000/year”. Maybe your income comes from a full time Internship that doesn’t pay well. In that case just estimate your monthly income and put that in the Income & Taxes Worksheet.

The columns of the Worksheet are the jobs you are planning on finding. There is space for four jobs; you should provide a name below each “Job 1” (e.g. Edward's Job #1 is waiter).
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Hours/Day: for example Edward assumes he is going to work 4 hours/day in his Waiter job</li>
	<li>Days/Week: for example Edward assumes he is going to work 4 days/week in that Waiter job</li>
	<li>Hourly Rate: Edward assumes $10/hour, with no tips for his waiter job</li>
<ul>
</ul>
In the end you take the Total Income/month (in bold Red) and enter it into the Income + Taxes worksheet.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Income &amp; Taxes</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
</ul>
Sub items: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K) and Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income.
<ul>
</ul>
Income
	<li><strong>Spouse #1 Income:</strong> It is likely your income will have been calculated using the Hourly Income Worksheet. Take the monthly income and put that in the Income &amp; Taxes Worksheet.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Spouse #2 Income:</strong> Most likely you won't be married at Age 22, Don wasn't. If you are then enter your Spouse's income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the Excel Budget Model Instructions in the Sub Navigation panel on the right and it will provide the instructions for this section.

	<li><h4><strong>Lodging Worksheet</strong></h4></li>

Sub items: Apartment rent or Mortgage payment, Homeowner Insurance or Renter Insurance and Homeowner Property Tax.

You might end up living at home until you find the professional job you want. Assuming your parents are not going to charge you rent you can put $0 in both of these fields. Many parents end up charging their child rent so you should probably use a real rental estimate. It will also make your financial projection more valuable, e.g. it will affect how much money you have to spend.

Edward visualizes himself living in a less expensive apartment (than at Age 26) with three other people. So he only has to pay ¼ of the rent. It is not practical to live at home because home is a small town and he will never find a professional job living at home.

In the Assumptions section of the Lodging Worksheet there are two sections: Own Your House/Condo or Rent an Apartment. You will use only one of those sections.
<ul>
</ul>
<li><h4><strong>Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4></li>

<strong>Sub items</strong>: Vacation, Improvements, Food, Fun, Financial Expense, Self, Spouse, Post Tax Savings and Gifts.

Edward estimated the Discretionary Expenses he plans to spend at Age 22, working in a 3 different Non Professional jobs.

	<li><h4><strong>Non-Discretionary Expenses Worksheet</strong></h4></li>

<strong>Sub items:</strong> Household, Medical, Personal Insurance, Pets, Transportation, Utilities, Debt Payments and Miscellaneous.

Edward estimated the Non Discretionary Expenses he expects. He has assumed he will live somewhere he can use public transportation.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong>Summary Worksheet</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
</ul>
The key focus item is at the bottom of this Worksheet – Surplus/Shortage. Edward'd final pass produced a surplus (a positive number). It was very hard to live on $20,000/year (his income estimate).
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h1><strong>Your Age 22 Budget Non-Professional Budget</strong></h1></li>

Make a copy of your own Budget Age 22 Excel file and change its name to YourName-Budget Age 22 Non-Professional. You can then change the numbers in your Budget Age 22 Excel file to reflect your life at Age 22 working in a Non Professional role, e.g. Income, Lodging, Expenses. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Warning</strong></h3>

<h5><strong>DO NOT input any data into the "Income and Expenses - Summary" Worksheet. Excel sources that data from all the other Worksheets, e.g. Income &amp; Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses</strong></h5>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on Excel Model Description to get a pdf document with instructions for each element in the Excel Model, or maybe you remember how to use the Excel Model from doing your Age 30 and Age 22-Professional Job Budgets.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>First enter your Income numbers, decide on Pre Tax Savings and calculate your Taxes. Use the Hourly Income Worksheet, which allows you to estimate jobs like waiters, laborers, etc. This will produce your Spendable Income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Second, make a 1st estimate of your lodging expenses, e.g. Don assumed he would room with three other people in a $2,000/month apartment, so his monthly rent would be $500.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Third take a look at your Surplus/Shortage number, which will be negative because you have less Spendable Income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Fourth start through your three categories of expenses (Lodging, Discretionary and Non-Discretionary) looking for places to cut expense.</li>
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></H1>
All of your financial analysis steps (Age 30, Age 22 and Age 22 Non-Professional Job) use the same Excel model; just the numbers you enter are different. 

They all have five Worksheets: Summary, Income/Taxes, Lodging (e.g. apartment rent or house payments), Detail-Discretionary Expenses and DetailNon-Discretionary Expenses. You do not enter any information into the Summary Worksheet; it gets its information from the other four Worksheets. When you enter data into the other Worksheets you use the Monthly column (the Yearly column is calculated by Excel). 

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Don-Budget-Age-30.pdf"target="_blank">Don Age 30 Budget</a> to see a pdf of Don’s Budget.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Worksheets</strong></H1>
Here is a description of each Worksheet and what you must do to complete it. You enter your information in the Monthly column, in the areas boxed in. 

If you are proficient in Excel you can make changes to the Worksheets, e.g. adding another sub category to Vacation. You must ensure the totals still calculate properly – Category (e.g. Vacation) and Worksheet (e.g. Income, Lodging, Discretionary and Non Discretionary. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Summary Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>
<strong>Sub items</strong>: Income, Before Tax Savings (e.g. 401K), Income Taxes (Federal, State, Social Security and Medicare) and Spendable Income. Total Expenses (Discretionary Expenses, Non-Discretionary Expenses and Lodging). Surplus or Shortage

<h5><strong>DO NOT</strong> input any data into the "Income and Expenses - Summary" page (page #1). Excel sources that data from all the other Worksheets, e.g. Income &amp; Taxes, Lodging, Discretionary Expenses</h5> If you want to change any data, e.g. Wages or  Vacation Expense you must go to the appropriate Worksheet and make those changes. The Summary worksheet line items are also summaries of several line items in the detail Worksheets, e.g. Vacation is not a single number, rather it is the following entries: Major Trips, Weekend Trips and Relative Visits. If you want to increase or decrease your Vacation expense you will have to make those changes in one or more of those three sub-categories.

There are multiple uses for the Summary worksheet:

	<li><strong>Surplus/Shortage:</strong> Validate you have created a budget that has a Surplus, rather than a shortage. Most likely your first pass at your budget will create a shortage, i.e. you will have spent more than your "Spendable Income". As you lower your expenses you will keep coming back to the Summary worksheet to see if you have gotten to a positive Surplus/Shortage number.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Spendable Income:</strong> Provide a high level summary of your Spendable Income. You can see, at a summary level, your Gross Income, Before Tax Savings, Taxes and Spendable Income. This may motivate you to increase or decrease your Before Tax Savings. You may be motivated to look for Professionals who could help you to lower your Taxes as a % of Income.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Provide a high level summary of your Expenses. You can view them in two major categories: Operating Expenses (Non-Discretionary and Discretionary) and Lodging. You can view them as a % of your Spendable Income, another effective way to analyze your expenses. You can quickly identify the top 3 Operating Expenses in Non-Discretionary and Discretionary expenses. At the summary level you may see some of the expenses are too low or too high relative to other expenses. </li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>What If:</strong> You can use the Summary worksheet to see the results of changing various aspects of your budget to see "What would happen if". You could test how much income you would need to support the expense level you want (just remember to revisit the Income Taxes Web sites as you increase your Income). At some Income level you will have enough to create a Surplus. You can then decide if that is a reasonable Income. You could do something similar with Expenses, e.g. what is the Income you would need to support the minimum Expenses you require. This is similar to the Age 22 Non-Professional exercise, e.g. what if you could only make $20,000 - can you come up with a reasonable set of expense assumptions to live at that Income level.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Income & Taxes Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>

<strong>Income</strong>: In the monthly column enter your Wages, Interest Income, Investment Income (e.g. Dividends, Capital Gains, Business Income) and Misc Income. Do the same for your Spouse. Don believes he will have a job with a $100,000/year income by Age 30. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Don-Salary-Fin-Analyst-IV_LA.pdf" target="_blank">Don's Salary Estimate</a> to see a pdf showing the inputs and outputs for Don at Age 30. You will notice he chose Los Angeles and Financial Analyst. If you want to use the same Web site to estimate your salary click on <a href="http://www.homefair.com/real-estate/salary-calculator.asp" target="_blank">Salary by Job Type</a>. You can then enter your job type and your location.

Excel will calculate the totals for each of you and the total for the family. It will also calculate what % each of you is contributing to the total family income, e.g. in Don's example he contributes about 70% and his spouse contributes about 30%. 

<strong>Before Tax Savings:</strong> Enter the amount of dollars you plan to contribute to your 401K (or Keogh Plan if you are going to be self-employed). For example you can decide that by age 30 you want to contribute 10% of your income/year into your company’s 401K (some companies will match your contribution). Excel will calculate the totals for each of you and the total for the family.
 
<strong>Federal, Social Security and Medicare:</strong> Click on <a href="http://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html"target="_blank">Take Home Pay Calculator</a> and it will assist you in estimating your taxes. Choose monthly Pay Frequency. Pick your filing status (either Single or Married filing jointly). Enter the # of Federal Tax Allowances (e.g. if you are married without children it is 2). Enter the 401K amount/month you chose in the Before Tax Savings section. Then enter the Gross Income you already estimated, if filing as Married you enter the total of your two incomes. If you are filing as single you only enter your income.

<strong>State Income Tax:</strong> If your state has an income tax, e.g. California does, Click on <a href="http://www.tax-rates.org/taxtables/income-tax-by-state"target="_blank">Income Tax by State</a> to access the Web site. You need to enter: Filing Status (e.g. single or married), Total Income (use the same yearly income you used in the Federal Tax calculation above), Deductions (select the “Use Federal and State Standard Deductions), Dependents (e.g. Single = 1 and Married = 2). Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Don-Taxes-Age-30-CA-Inc-Tax.pdf"target="_blank">Don's California Tax</a> to see a pdf of Don’s inputs and outputs using the Web site.

<strong>Data Entry:</strong> the Web sites provide your tax as an annual amount. You should enter it as $Tax/12 (e.g. $1,000 = $12,000/12 in the monthly field and you will see the $12,000 appear in the Yearly field). 

<strong>Spendable Income:</strong> Excel will calculate this for you by subtracting your “Before Tax Savings” (e.g. 401K contribution) and your Income Taxes from your Gross Income. This is the amount of money in your pay check each pay period. You have to learn to live on your Take Home Pay.

	<li><h2><strong>Income Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>
<strong>Sub items</strong>: Job Description, Income/Week, Income/Month and Income/Year.

This Worksheet is mainly used for the Age 22-NonProfessional exercise. For example you may believe you can earn $20,000/year ($1,667/month) and will figure out later what job (s) would allow you to earn $1,667/month. What you want to find out is “how can I live on $20,000/year”.

<strong>Job Description</strong>: There are four columns, one for each of four jobs. For example Don assumed he had three jobs: Waiter, Bike shop salesman and high school math tutor.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Income/Week</strong>: For each of the jobs you can enter the hours/day and days/week you will work and Excel will calculate the Hours/week you will be working on that job. You can input an hourly rate for each job and Excel will then calculate your weekly income for that job. It also allows you to add an estimate of Tips and produces a total Income/Week for each job. 
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Income/Month</strong>: Using the Income/Week information from above Excel calculates your Income/Month (which is shown in Red). You take this number and enter it in the Income & Taxes Worksheet as your Monthly Income. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Lodging Worksheet Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>
<strong>Sub items</strong>: Apartment rent or Mortgage payment, Homeowner Insurance or Renter Insurance and Homeowner Property Tax.

Rent or Mortgage Payment (you choose one or the other, not both):

<strong>Rent</strong>: Estimate the total rent/month for your apartment, along with the number of roommates. Excel will calculate “Your Rent” by dividing the Total by the # of Roommates. Enter that number in the monthly Mortgage or Rent field.

<strong>House Affordability:</strong> 
Explore how much you can borrow: Click on <a href="http://www.calculator.net/house-affordability-calculator.html"target="_blank">House Affordability</a> to access the Web site. Enter your annual income (you may want to only enter the income of the person who will be working if you have children – that is what Don did). Keep the following the same as in the model: “your planned loan term” at 30 years, “interest rate” at 6% and “percentage of down payment” at 20%. Hit “Submit” to receive the amount of money you can borrow, e.g. $300,000. There are two estimates, use the Safe one (debt to income rate of 28%). Round that off and use it as your loan payment below.

Homeowner or Renter Insurance (you choose one or the other; not both):

Homeowner: The Excel model calculated this when you entered the price of your home.
Renter: You enter the total Renters Insurance. It will divide that by the number of roommates to give you “Your Renter’s Insurance” amount. Enter that number in the area above.

Property Tax: This only applies when you own a home. Excel has calculated that amount and you need to enter it.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Discretionary vs. Non Discretionary Concept</strong></H2></li>	
At the start, all of your expenses are discretionary, i.e. you get to decide how much you want to spend on that category. But soon there are sets of expenses for which you have little control, e.g. once you sign an apartment lease you are stuck with that monthly rent for another year. You also have little control over the Utilities’ expenses that come with that apartment Once you buy a car you will not be able to control most of those expense except gas (and that may be controlled by your work commute).

There are sets of expenses, discretionary, that you have a lot more control over. You decide your vacation expenses (e.g. major trips, weekend trips, family visits), fun expenses (e.g. eating out, cable TV, health club) and personal expenses (e.g. clothes, personal care). Even food is discretionary. You can buy food and cook it or do Take Out.
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Discretionary Expenses Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>	
<strong>Sub items</strong>: Vacation, Improvements, Food, Fun, Financial Expense, Self, Spouse, Post Tax Savings and Gifts.

Enter a monthly $ figure for each subcategory, e.g. in Vacation you will enter Major Trips, Weekend Trips and Family Visits. In some cases the yearly amount is easier to understand, e.g. you plan one Major Trip that you estimate will cost $5,000. You will need to enter $5,000/12 in the monthly field and Excel will calculate the Yearly amount. In other cases the most natural entry is monthly, e.g. in Fun you plan on belonging to a Health Club and that is $75/month.

Category/Subcategory Definitions (you enter the data at the subcategory level):
Vacation: It has 3 self-explanatory subcategories – Major Trips, Weekend Trips and Family Visits.

Improvements: Home/Apartment (e.g. a new couch), Yard (e.g. plants), Technology (e.g. a new TV set – if the technology is personal, e.g. a cell phone, it goes in your own Category – Self or Spouse)

Food: Groceries (e.g. food you buy at Trader Joe’s), Take Home (e.g. getting a pizza rather than cooking), 

Lunches (e.g. what you spend each day at work on lunch) and Liquor (e.g. buying beer & wine for home).

Post Tax Savings (not 401K because it is a Pre Tax Saving): Savings (e.g. 5% of your salary goes into a savings account and maybe then invested), House Down payment (e.g. setting aside 10% of your income to make a down payment on a house later), Emergency Fund (e.g. saving money for unexpected expenses like having to get new tires before you planned).

Gifts: Family/Friends (e.g. birthday and Christmas), Other (e.g. gift to your doorman, political donations), Tax Deductible Donations (e.g. College Alumni Fund, Goodwill)
 <ul>
</ul>
	<li><h2><strong>Non-Discretionary Expenses Worksheet:</strong></H2></li>
<strong>Sub items</strong>: Household, Medical, Personal Insurance, Pets, Transportation, Utilities, Debt Payments, Miscellaneous

Enter a monthly $ figure for each subcategory and Excel will calculate the Yearly amount. 

Category/Subcategory Definitions (you enter the data at the subcategory level):

Household: Housekeeper (e.g. entire amount or your share if you roommates), House (e.g. sheets, towels, hardware), Magazines/Papers, Postage/Shipping (e.g. US Post Office, FedEx), Other

Go to <a href="http://www.calculator.net/auto-loan-calculator.html" target="_blank">Auto Loan Calculator</a> to get the amount of car loan payments you must make (assuming you have to buy a car). On the Web site you need to enter: auto price, loan term (months), interest rate, down payment, trade-in value and sales tax. Use a 36 month loan term, don't assume any trade-in-value and use 6% for the sales tax. Don then used the “monthly pay” from the "Auto Loan Calculator" in his auto loan payment cell. He assumed both he and his spouse had purchased $20,000 cars and were making the same car payments.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></H1>
There are a large number of Web sites to assist you in this assignment. Each step has links to the appropriate Web sites, instructions on how to use them and how you use the Web site output in your Excel model.

Web sites are categorized as: Salary, Taxes, Locations, Housing and Eduation. Using Google you can find other Web sites for doing the same thing, e.g. Affordable Housing, Salary Guidelines and Auto Loans.

If you find Web sites that you find valuable pass them along to Don@My-Right-Career.com and they may be added to this Resource list.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Salary</strong></H1>
<strong><a href="http://www.homefair.com/real-estate/salary-calculator.asp" target="_blank"> Salary by Job Type</a></strong> 
Measure your job compensation to the closest match in this database by searching on job title and location. Compare over a thousand job descriptions in over 300 U.S. cities. Know the base pay and the total cash compensation (bonuses) for the job you want, before you negotiate! See concise and informative data, quickly and easily. Be informed and maximize your earning potential.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Taxes</strong></H1>
<strong><a href="http://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html" target="_blank"> Federal Income Taxes</a> </strong>
In the United States, your gross income after tax and deductions is the "actual income" you will bring home. If you are an employee, your employer will withhold your tax and deductions from your paycheck. If you are self-employed, you are responsible for submitting your taxes either every quarter or every year, and paying for your own benefits. This Web site assists you in calculating your specific Federal Income tax, Social Security tax and the Medicare tax. It doesn’t provide state income taxes.

<strong><a href="http://www.tax-rates.org/taxtables/income-tax-by-state" target="_blank"> State Income Taxes</a></strong>
View relative tax rates across the U.S. based on the lowest, average, or highest tax brackets. The site will then help you calculate your specific state taxes.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Locations</strong></H1>
<strong><a href="http://www.homefair.com" target="_blank">Location Info</a></strong>
You can use this Web site to research cities in which you have an interest.  Examples of reports you can get are: Salary Calculator (What are you worth? Compare your salary in different cities.), Cost of Living (Is it really less expensive to live in the suburbs? What if you work in the city? Is LA more expensive than NYC or Boston?), City Profile (Gives you a snapshot of demographics, finances, economics and other quality-of-life factors so you can find a place where you'll feel at home.)

<strong><a href="http://www.realtor.com/rentals" target="_blank">Apartments</a>  </strong>
Find apartments anywhere in the US via the Official Site of the National Association of REALTORS®. 

<strong><a href="http://www.realtor.com/" target="_blank">Homes</a></strong>
Find homes anywhere in the US via the Official Site of the National Association of REALTORS®.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/" target="_blank">Craigslist</a></strong>
Find almost anything via Craigslist. There is a unique Craigslist for most areas, e.g. San Francisco Bay area.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Housing Loans</strong></H1>
<strong><a href="http://www.calculator.net/house-affordability-calculator.html"target="_blank">House Affordability</a></strong> 
Explore how much you can borrow. Enter your annual income (you may want to only enter the income of the person who will be working if you have children – that is what Don did). Keep the following the same as in the model: “your planned loan term” at 30 years, “interest rate” at 6% and “percentage of down payment” at 20%. Hit “Submit” to receive the amount of money you can borrow, e.g. $300,000. There are two estimates, use the Safe one (debt to income rate of 28%). Round that off and use it as your loan payment below. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Don-Age-30-House-Affordability-Calculator.pdf"target="_blank">Don House Affordability</a> to see a pdf of Don’s inputs and outputs using the Web site.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong><a href="http://www.homefair.com/tools/mortgage-payment-calculator"target="_blank">House Mortgage Calculator</a></strong>. 
Enter the Principal Balance from above, the Annual Interest Rate, the Amortization Length (e.g. 30 years). Leave the Starting month already entered. Pick “Monthly” as the payment method. Hit “Submit” to receive your Monthly Payment (e.g. $1,288). Enter that amount in the monthly Mortgage Payment field in the top of the page of your Lodging worksheet.Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Don-Age-30-Mortgage-Calculator.pdf"target="_blank">Don's Mortgage Payments</a> to see a pdf of Don’s inputs and outputs using the Web site.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Car Loans</strong></H1>
Go to <a href="http://www.calculator.net/auto-loan-calculator.html" target="_blank">Auto Loan Calculator</a> to get the amount of car loan payments you must make (assuming you have to buy a car). On the Web site you need to enter: auto price, loan term (months), interest rate, down payment, trade-in value and sales tax. Use a 36 month loan term, don't assume any trade-in-value and use 6% for the sales tax. You can then enter the “monthly pay” from the "Auto Loan Calculator" in your auto loan payment cell.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>College Cost & Trust Funds</strong></H1>
Go to <a href="https://www.archimedes.com/blackrock/costwait/costwait_adv.phtml" target="_blank">College Cost</a> to estimate future college cost and the amount you will need to save to pay for college. When a child is born, it can be hard to imagine that he or she will be heading off to college in a few short years. The reality is, however, that starting early can reap significant benefits when it comes to saving for higher education. Use the BlackRock Cost of Waiting College Savings Calculator to estimate your child's future college costs and compare the lump-sum and monthly savings you will need to put aside if you begin investing for college now and at various intervals in the future. On the Web site you will need to enter: Average cost in today's dollars, e.g $40,000, Years until college (assume 18), Years in college (assume 4), College Cost Inflation (4% is a good assumption) and Return on your investment (6% is a good assumption). The model will tell you how much you will need to save/month. Don assumed he would send his kids to a college that cost $50,000/year in today's dollars. In 18 years that same college will cost $518,000 for four years (vs. $200,000 today). He will need to start saving $1,340/month once his first child is born to pay for that college. He plans on having two kids so that amount more than doubles.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Education – Dummies Series</strong></H1>
Overview: You do not need to use these educational resources to complete the Economic Engine assignment. But they might help you out on the basics.

<strong><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/personal-finance/budgets/creating.html" target="_blank">Budgeting</a> </strong>
Does the word “budget” send chills up your spine? It shouldn’t. Budgets allow you to have some control over what you spend. A monthly budget can help you to decide how to spend your money, plan for your future, and pay off existing debt, and save a few pennies each month by reducing wasteful and impulsive purchases. 

<strong><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/personal-finance/net-worth.html" target="_blank">Net Worth (Balance Sheet) </a> </strong>
A net worth statement is simply a listing of all that you own and all that you owe. The difference between what you own and what you owe is your net worth. Your net worth is like a financial report card because it reveals a lot about you. In fact, people tend to be more comfortable talking about their sex lives than their financial lives. No one can prove whether someone has been a fantastic lover. However, one glance at a net worth statement, and you have a pretty good idea whether a person has made a lot of financial mistakes, had terrible misfortune, has been a fantastic money manager, or is just darn lucky.

<strong><a href="http://www.dummies.com/store/product/Excel-2010-For-Dummies-eLearning-Online-Course.productCd-DUM132.html" target="_blank">Excel</a></strong>
This online course covers the basics of creating Excel spreadsheets, creating and using formulas and functions, and formatting worksheets. You will move at your own pace through three interactive lessons, discovering how worksheets work, how to add and edit content, what formulas and functions do, and how to format your spreadsheet to best demonstrate your data. In each lesson, you'll find clear, expert instruction, interactive quizzes, hands-on activities, summaries, and a way to review topics so you can progress at your own pace.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 5 - Optional: Financials of Raising a Family</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Maybe you have started to think about having a family. Most likely you want to wait until you meet the right person, get married and live together for awhile before bringing someone else into your life. You may have thought about the timing, e.g. not until after age 30 and not until we are financially more stable. So what will it cost to raise a child? What if you want two or three children?

The United States Department of Agriculture Department publishes an annual report on what
families spend on their children from Age 0 to Age 17. There are also a couple of interesting articles, one in the Wall Street Journal and one in the New York Times, that use the USDA report as the basis for their analysis.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>What are the USDA Findings?</strong></h1>
The USDA report only address the expenses from Age 0 to Age 17. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/USDA-Expenditures-on-Children-2011.pdf" target="_blank">USDA Expenditures on Children 2011</a> to see the USDA report. It provides the data using two variables:
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Categories of Expenses</strong></h3>
The USDA breaks down the expenses into the following categories: Housing, Food, Transportation, Clothing, Health Care, Child Care/Education and Miscellaneous. 

<h3><strong>Income Levels</strong></h3>
Household income and child-raising expenses are positively correlated, i.e. the more you make, the more you spend on your children. The amount of money spent on a child in the highest income group (average income of $178,000) was more than twice that spent by a family in the lowest income group (average income of $38,000). The lowest income group spent $183,000, the middle income group spent $250,000 and the highest income group spent $415,000.

But as a % of income the families in the highest income group spent only 12% of their income on their children compared to the 25% spent by families in the lowest income group. Families in the middle income group (average income of $79,000) spent 16%.

Edward is projecting he will earn $100,000 by Age 30 and probably start a family by Age 32. He will be in the highest income group during the time he is raising his children so the USDA report projects him spending $415,000 per child from Age 0 to Age 17.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>What about College Expenses?</strong></h1>
Since you are just finishing or have finished college it is likely you will want your children to go to college as well. Maybe you will want them to go to a college as good as or better than the one you attended.

Go to <a href="https://www.archimedes.com/blackrock/costwait/costwait_adv.phtml" target="_blank">College Cost</a> to estimate future college cost and the amount you will need to save to pay for college. When a child is born, it can be hard to imagine that he or she will be heading off to college in a few short years. The reality is, however, that starting early can reap significant benefits when it comes to saving for higher education. 

Use the BlackRock Cost of Waiting College Savings Calculator to estimate your child's future college costs and compare the lump-sum and monthly savings you will need to put aside if you begin investing for college now and at various intervals in the future. On the Web site you will need to enter: Average cost in today's dollars, e.g $40,000, Years until college (assume 18), Years in college (assume 4), College Cost Inflation (4% is a good assumption) and Return on your investment (6% is a good assumption). The model will tell you how much you will need to save/month. 

Edward assumed he would send his kids to a college that cost $50,000/year in today's dollars. In 18 years that same college will cost $518,000 for four years (vs. $200,000 today). He will need to start saving $1,340/month once his first child is born to pay for that college. He plans on having two kids so that amount more than doubles.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Maybe it is Even Higher</strong></h1>
Two articles have been written that say, for higher income parents, the cost of rearing a child are significantly higher than the USDA estimates.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Million Dollar Kid - Wall Street Journal</strong></h3>
Go to <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Million-Dollar-Kid-WSJ.com_.pdf" target="_blank">Million Dollar Kid</a> to see how the Wall Street Journal deconstructed the government's approach (note they were using the USDA 2007 report as their starting point, not 2011) and recalculated it using a different range of costs. Below are some quotes from the article:

Escalating kid spending is more rampant among wealthier households, so we used the government's top-third income bracket as a starting point. We also added some costs that aren't included in that government calculation, such as college-savings plans, which a growing number of households are setting up for their kids. We placed all these expenses on a spectrum, from those that parents and experts say are the most common, up to more unusual -- and costly -- frills. At the lowest end, our estimates came in at about $800,000 (in 2007 dollars) through the age of 17. Add in extras like private school, a nanny and a flat-screen TV set in a kid's bedroom, and that figure climbs to $1.6 million.

Some of the costs can add up quickly. For parents whose kids are passionate athletes, for instance, baseball equipment, including helmets, cleats and uniforms, costs in the realm of $3,000 from the age of 10 to 17 -- and taking it one step further by enrolling in an elite youth team can pile on a further $12,500 for annual travel expenses. Fully half of American teenagers now own MP3 players, according to research by the Pew Internet & American Life Project; a year of daily iTunes downloads for these kids -- their version of a daily latte fix -- comes to $361 and change.

The biggest and most common driver is education. One in 10 children now goes to private or parochial school. Even at a relatively modest tuition at a parochial school of $6,000 a year, that would add $60,000 or more to the government's total figure of $36,000 for education and child care. Likewise, academic extras are becoming routine; the average income of a family seeking tutoring for a child is between $50,000 and $75,000, according to Eduventures, a Boston-based market-research firm.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>It is even more expensive - New York Times</strong></h3>
Go to <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/The-Cost-of-Raising-a-Child-NYTimes.com_.pdf" target="_blank">Another View of Raising a Child Expenses</a> to see how the author estimated her cost of raising a child. She concluded it would cost $1.8M. She also used the USDA report as her starting point and then tailored it to her geography (NYC) and situation. She stuck with the USDA's estimates for food, transportation, clothing and miscellaneous for a two-parent household in the Urban Northeast in the top earning group (over $103,000). The largest "cost" she added was her lost income for being a working Mom - lost wages while on Maternity Leave and earning only 73% of a male's income (vs. 90% if not a mother). This working Mom "cost" came to $700,000 over the 18 years.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Cost of Raising your Children</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Don's Example</strong></h3>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Raising-Family-Budget.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Having a Family Financials</a> to see how much Edward has estimated it would cost him to raise two kids. His total cost is almost $700,000 per child or a total of almost $1.4M for his two planned children.

He assumed he would be in the highest Income group and used the USDA Age 0 to Age 17 cost data, showing he will spend $414,000 per child. This figure will probably be higher if he provides his kids the same benefits his parents provided him, e.g. playing on elite sports teams (including private coaches), private high school and tutors. He then assumed he would send his kids to a college that was as expensive as the one he attended ($50,000/year), which will cost him $238,000 per child. Last he assumed he would spend $40,000 in post college expenses on each child for items like them living at home after college, helping them buy their first home and money for grandchildren.
<ul>

<h3><strong>Your Estimate</strong></h3>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Raising-Family-Budget.xlsx" target="_blank"> Template Raising Family Budget</a> to download an Excel file you can use as a template. Change the name of the file to YourName-Raising_Family_Budget.xls. The top part of the Excel spreadsheet (Your Situation) is where you enter your information. Just enter your information in the cells with a box around them. This is Edward's example.

<strong>Income Group</strong>: First decide on the Income group by entering the Income you feel you will have around the time you will have your first child.
 
<strong>Age 0 to 17 Expenses</strong>: If it is over $102,000 you are then in the highest income bracket and would use those USDA expenses ($414,240) for the column titled Age 0 to 17. 

<strong>College</strong>: For the column titled College decide what college cost level (in today's dollars) you plan for your child. If you are going to a $40,000 college (total cost = Tuition, Room/Board, Other Expenses) you may want to plan on sending your child to a school in the same cost range. You can decide you will only pay for 50% of their college education and let them pay for the rest through scholarships and student loans. If so you would only have to save for a $20,000 college to send them to a $40,000 college.

<strong>Post College:</strong> This would cover items like them living at home after college, helping them buy their first home and money for grandchildren.

<strong>Total</strong>: To get your Total you need to decide on many children you will have. If your children are several years apart the costs will be higher because of inflation but this is a adequate estimate.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>

As we told you earlier, you will discover there is almost nothing in life that does’t have a financial dimension to it, even deciding to get married or have children, two of the most personal decisions in life. 

You can find a career at which you can Be your Best because it leverages your Strengths, Skills and Personality. That same career may have enormous Meaning to you and you work with great Passion. But if society doesn’t value that career enough to Fuel Your Economic Engine it probably is not your Right Career. If it doesn’t pay you enough to support your family in a reasonable manner it is probably not your Right Career. You get to decide what is reasonable.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Tracking your Expenses</strong></h1>
In a video about managing your money one group said there are three things you must do: 1) Start with a goal (e.g. save for a car, pay down your college debt), 2) Create a Plan (a Budget) and 3) Track your Expenses (keep track of everything you spend and put them in categories).

You can track your expenses by putting all your receipts and credit cards in a box. Then you can enter that data into an accounting system like Mint.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Living within Your Budget</strong></h1>
It is a lot easier to come up with some numbers that solve to a balance budget, than it is to actually not spend more than you make each month. If you think you will have the problem of running out of money at the end of the month (or already do have that problem) here is an interesting simple solution;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared your Age 30 and Age 22 Budgets with them. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<h1><strong>Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
<ul>
<strong>Age 30 Budget:</strong> Share your budget and your insights.

<strong>Age 22 Budget:</strong> Share your budget and your insights.

<strong>Optional Exercises:</strong> If you did any of these then consider sharing them with your Adviser. This is especially true if you feel you need some guidance or help.
		<li><strong>- Age 22 Non-Professional Budget</strong>: If you think there is a chance you will not work in your chosen field for awhile then discuss the economic reality of that situation.<strong> </strong>
	<strong>- Financials of Buying a House:</strong> If you are interested in purchasing a house before you are 30 discuss that with your Adviser. While they may not be able to give you good advice they probably know people who could.
	<strong>- Financials of Raising a Family:</strong> If you plan on having a family consider discussing the financial implications with your Adviser</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents::</strong> These are the most important documents you will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. These documents must be discussed.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done a lot of exercises and you should have a handle on the schedule by now.

<strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> Most likely you have now settled into a process that works for the two of you, e.g. how you communicate, how you review.

<strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these exercises.]]></content:encoded>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: StrengthsFinder Report, Strengths/Talents Insights, Strengths Ideas for Action and Ideas for Action Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>C) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on Exercise #2 and then not again until Exercise #4 and #5.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey's examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> You have now identified a how you are going to balance your income and expense, some of them are related to your natural personality and strengths. Add insights you have gained to this file. You should be able to find a lot of insights, just like Don did.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are there areas where you economic interests and your passion intersect? It is very normal for you to find meaning and have passion for things that interest you.

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your interests to fuel you economic engine. Do you see how your Whole Person may cause you to require more fuel.

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> What careers and jobs did you identify? 

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> Your Whole Person parameters (e.g. where you want to live, your vacation desires, if you want to own a home) have a huge impact on your Budget.

<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

Your assignment involves these steps: 1) Review your existing MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights file, 2) Create a Meaning Insights Summary, 3) Provide feedback, 4) Discuss your completed exercise with your Adviser and 5) Become an Example. The Basic Assignment (Steps 1 & 2) will take you about 2 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Meaning/Passion Approach</strong></h1>
The 2nd circle in the Right Career Venn diagram is Meaning/Passion. By now you have completed a lot of exercises that don't address the subject directly (e.g. Begin at the End, Autobiography, Personality) but may have prompted some thoughts about what has meaning for you and for what you have a passion. In this Assignment you have completed some exercises (Stories, Drivers, Measure Your Life) that are designed to more directly address the Meaning/Passion subject.

This exercise, Meaning Insights, provided you with an opportunity to reach a conclusion on what has meaning to you and for what you have passion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
Your assignment involves these steps: 1) Read "How Will You Measure Your Life" article, 2) Answer the three questions, 3) Provide feedback, 4) Discuss your completed exercise with your Adviser and 5) Become an Example. The Basic Assignment (Steps 1 & 2) will take you about 2 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>1) Read "How Will You Measure Your Life" article</strong></h1>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Measure-your-Life-Article.pdf" target="_blank">"How Will You Measure Your Life" article</a>. This is a short summary of the original text from Clayton Christensen's "How Will You Measure Your Life" book. Here are some quotes from the article.

Every five years, Clayton  Christensen and his peers gathered for a reunion at the Harvard Business School. As a group, they clearly had much to celebrate: They had wonderful jobs, they had made great achievements, and some were financially successful beyond their wildest dreams. But behind the facade of professional success, Christensen observed something was not right. Many of his peers were clearly not happy. At graduation, they had plans and visions for what they would accomplish, not just in their careers, but in their personal lives as well.

Yet, at reunions, he realized that something had gone wrong for some of them along the way. Their personal relationships had begun to deteriorate, even as their professional prospects blossomed. For others, careers that began with great promise and reached the pinnacle of success had come crashing down.

No one graduates from business school with a deliberate strategy to get divorced, lose touch with their children, or make choices that land you in jail. Yet this is the exact strategy that too many people end up implementing.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>2) Answer the three questions</strong></h1>
Christen's three questions are:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h5><strong>1) How can I be sure I will be successful and happy in my career?</strong></H5></li>
 <ul>
</ul>
	<li><H5><strong>2) How can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse, my children, my extended family and close friends become an enduring source of happiness?</strong></H5></li>
 <ul>
</ul>
	<li><H5><strong>3) How can I live a life of integrity — and stay out of jail?</strong></H5></li>
<ul>
</ul>
Below are two examples of answering those three questions:

</ul>
<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this exercise you need to: 1) Take StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment, 2) Create your Talents/Strenghts Insights, 3) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights document the insights you have gained from this exercise, 4) Discuss the exercise with your Facilitator, 5) Provide Feedback and 6) Become an example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. In total the first four steps will probably take you about 3 hours.
<ul>
</ul>
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Strengths_Checklist.pdf"target="_blank">Strengths Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the exercise. You can use this to keep track of your progress and to communicate your progress to your Facilitator. They will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page.
<ul>
</ul>
There are two approaches you can take to complete exercises: Short Instructions or Full Instructions. You can also use a hybrid approach in at least two different ways: 1) Use the Short Instructions for one Step and then switch to the Full Instructions on another Step if you need more help or 2) Use the Short Instructions on a Step until you need more help on that Step and then go directly to the Full Instructions on that Step for more instructions.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/skills-strengths/strenght/short-instructions-strengths/">Short Instructions Approach</a></strong></h1>
If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically listening to a 5 minute video and using examples to do your work. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/skills-strengths/strenght/full-instructions-strenghts/">Step 0 - Introduction</a></strong></h1>
If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the same 5 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
Write stories about at least two of your Major Accomplishments you enjoyed doing. Write a story about an accomplishment you did not enjoy doing, but still are proud of completing.
<ul>
</ul>
To complete this step you should have your list of Top Accomplishments from the Accomplishments Exercise. If you did not complete the Accomplishments Exercise you have several choices:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Go back to the Autobiography Assignment and complete "Step 1 - Write Your Autobiography". Then go to the Accomplishments Assignment and using your Autobiography, complete "Step 1 - List of Accomplishments" and "Step 2 - List of Top Accomplishments". This is probably the easiest way and certainly the most complete way to arrive at your Top Accomplishments</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Go back the Accomplishments Assignment and complete "Step 1 - List of All Accomplishments" and "Step 2 - List of Top Accomplishments". This assumes you can identify your "List of All Accomplishments" without creating your Autobiography.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Go back the Accomplishments Assignment and complete "Step 2 - List of Top Accomplishments". This assumes you can identify your Top Accomplishments without your "List of All Accomplishments".</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Create your Stories without referencing your Accomplishments, e.g. the two stories I want to write are X & Y.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>1) Write a 1 page Story for each Accomplishment</strong></h1>
When I say a “one” page story don’t take that literally. Most people write stories (including insights) that range from 3/4 of a page to 2 pages. Just don’t get carried away and write a 5 page short story.
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-Newspaper.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Newspaper Story</a> for Edward's story about “Founding & running the college newspaper” when he was a junior in college. It is an example of a one page story. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>2) Document your Insights</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Edward-NewspaperInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Newspaper Story Insights</a> for his insights of “Founding & running the College newspaper”. Edward incorporated his insights within the story by highlighting portions of the text in bold red and then providing an INSIGHT statement in bold blue after the highlighted section.
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Casey-SoccerEndurance.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Soccer Endurance</a> for her story about building up her soccer endurance. Casey combined her story and her story insights into one file. Her Insights are at the end of the file.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>3) Provide feedback</strong></h1>
You will provide feedback for all the Meaning Exercises at the end of the Meaning Insights Exercise.

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>4) Discuss your exercise with your Adviser</strong></h1>
You should wait until you have finished all of your Meaning Exercises before you discuss them with your Adviser.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>5) Become an Example</strong></h1>
You can can wait until you have finished all of the Meaning Exercises and then send them all to Don to turn into Examples.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
To help you complete the exercise here are Casey's Examples and a Word template:
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Casey's Examples:
</strong> </strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Casey-Drivers_List.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Top Drivers List</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Casey-Drivers_Insights.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Drivers Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Template:</strong> Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Template-Drivers_List.doc"target="_blank">Drivers Template</a> and you will download a Word file that will be your template for this exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>1) Identify your Top 10 Drivers, besides money</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
Highlight those Drivers you believe are your top 10. You may have to make multiple passes to arrive at the true Top 10 Drivers. When you are done your document should look like <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Casey-Drivers_List.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Top Drivers List</a>.
<ul>
</ul> 
<h1><strong>2) Document the insights you gained</strong></h1>

Use the file you just created as the template for this step. Make a copy of the file and rename it YourName-Drivers_Insights. Now remove all the Drivers that are not on your Top 10 list (i.e. the ones that are not highlighted).
<ul>
</ul>
Spend some time thinking about how your life, so far, has been affected by the Drivers you have identified. Have your past roles and organizations met those Drivers? Have you left roles because they did not meet those Drivers? Do you find yourself attracted to new roles, organizations or industries because they fulfill certain of those Drivers? The insights you identify may help you identify your Right Career.

You should add insights for each drive and then some general insights. When you are done it should look like <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Casey-Drivers_Insights.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Drivers Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>3) Provide feedback</strong></h1>
You will provide feedback for all the Meaning Exercises at the end of the Meaning Insights Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>4) Discuss your exercise with your Adviser</strong></h1>
You should wait until you have finished all of your Meaning Exercises before you discuss them with your Adviser.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you need to review your MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights file you have been adding to with each exercise and pick out the significant items that contribute to your overall Meaning/Passion. Second you need to create a Meaning Insights summary.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>1) Highlight the Key Insights</strong></h1>

Go through your MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights file and highlight those insights you find most meaningful. You can do this either by printing out the file and doing it with a highlighter or you can just highlight the electronic file. Both Casey and Edward highlighted in Blue all the areas they felt deserved to be part of their summary. Below are their examples:
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Highlighted.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Highlighted File</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Edward-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Highlighted.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Meaning & Passion" Highlighted File</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>2) Create a Meaning Insights Summary</strong></h1>
Below are examples for both Casey and Edward. They identified the items that provided the most meaning to them. Then on that page they copied the items from their MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights file they felt supported that conclusion, usually the items they had highlighted in Step 1.

The Short Summary is the start of each file (the first five pages for Edward and the first two pages for Casey).
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights Summary</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Edward-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Meaning & Passion" Insights Summary</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>3) Provide feedback</strong></h1>
You will provide feedback for all the Meaning Exercises at the end of the Meaning Insights Exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>4) Discuss your exercise with your Adviser</strong></h1>
You should wait until you have finished all of your Meaning Exercises before you discuss them with your Adviser.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>5) Become an Example</strong></h1>
You can can wait until you have finished all of the Meaning Exercises and then send them all to Don to turn into Examples.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Below are examples from this Exercise: College Students, Recent Graduates and Experienced Adults.

These are summaries of their Meaning Insights from all of the exercises.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Casey - End Sophomore Year</strong></h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights Summary</a>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Edward - End Junior Year</strong></h2>

<ul>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Experienced Adults</strong></h1>
Below are examples that can be of value to an Experienced Adult who wants to use the MyRightCareer System for their own life or just see examples more like themselves to improve their ability to be an Adviser. 

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the “Experienced Adult” heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

College students may also find these examples useful because they show 1) how this technique can be used the rest of your life and 2) some interesting examples of how someone more your parent's age used the approach.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples this Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>0) Introduction</strong></h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuZBJQAFOfM" target="_blank">Strengths Concept in 2 minutes Video</a></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to see a video where Marcus Buckingham provides a quick overview of the Strengths concept via a simple example. At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
To see a longer video where Marcus Buckingham describes the Strengths concept in more detail and more importantly the two myths that hold 80% of people back from leveraging their natural strengths click on Step 0 - Introduction-Strengths in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>1) StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment</strong></h3>
You need to do an assessment before you can do the actual exercises (which use the outputs of the assessment). 
<ul>
</ul>
To see an example of the output click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrengthsFinder.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's StrengthsFinder2 Report</a>

To find out how to access the assessment click on Step 1 - StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2) Strengths Awareness</strong></h3>
In the StrengthsFinder 2.0 Report, study Section I (Awareness), which describe what makes you stand out from others with the same theme in their top five.
<ul>
</ul>
For an example click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-StrengthsFinder.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's StrengthsFinder2 Report</a>
<ul>
</ul>
Create a one page summary of what you have learned by looking at all five Top Talents. You most likely have common themes running through your Top Talents.
<ul>
</ul>
For an example click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Casey-Strengths-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Strengths Insights</a>.
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 2 - Strengths Awareness in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

</ul>
<h3><strong>3) Ideas for Action</strong></h3>
In the StrengthsFinder2 Report (Section II - Action Planning Guide) there are 10 Recommended Actions you can take for each of your Five Top Talents.
<ul>
</ul>
For an example click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-Action-Planning-Guide.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Action Planning Guide</a>
<ul>
</ul>
Pick at least three of the 10 Ideas for Action for each of your top five themes that you would like to implement during the next year. Create a one page summary of what you have learned by looking at all your Ideas for Action. If you picked three for each of your Top 5 Talents you will have 30 Ideas for Action. You most likely have common themes running through those 30 Ideas for Action.
<ul>
</ul>
For an example click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Casey-Ideas_for_Action-Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Ideas for Action Insights</a>.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on Step 3 - Structural Tension in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4) Document your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h3>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
