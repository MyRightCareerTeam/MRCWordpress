<h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuZBJQAFOfM"target="_blank">Strengths Concept in 2 minutes Video</a></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to see a video where Marcus Buckingham provides a quick overview of the Strengths concept via a simple example. At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.

</ul>
<h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWZTdso2Njs&feature=related" target="_blank">Strengths Concept & Two Myths Holding You Back Video</a></h4>
<ul>
</ul>
Click on the link above to see a video where Marcus Buckingham describes the Strengths concept in more detail and more importantly the two myths that hold 80% of people back from leveraging their natural strengths. 

	<li><strong>Myth #1 - As you grow you will change</strong>
<strong>Truth</strong> - As you grow you will become more and more of who you already are (in regards to your personality)</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Myth #2 - You will grow the most in your areas of weakness.</strong> 
<strong>Truth</strong> - You will grow the most in your areas of strengths. While you can grow in an area of weakness it will be minimal and it will be painful (you do have to figure out how to compensate or work around areas of weakness).</li>

<ul>
</ul>
For those of you who like to read, the StrengthsFinder 2.0 book Part I (Finding Your Strengths - An Introduction) provides an explanation of the strengths concept. Marcus Buckingham co-authored, with Donald Clifton (the father of the Strengths Movement), "Now, Discover Your Strengths". While it was written in 2000 it is still a very good description of the strengths concept and how to apply it in your life.

Click on <a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/"target="_blank">Gallup Strengths Center</a> to access a wide range of Strengths material. In the next Step (StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment) you will go to a different section of this Web site to purchase a code to take the StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If the Strengths concept is new to you click on Step 0 - Introduction and watch the two videos by Marcus Buckingham: "Strengths Concept in 2 Minutes" and "Strengths Concept and Two Myths Holding You Back" (7 minutes). You should also watch the Welcome to Strengths video. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as they do this exercise:
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>StrengthsFinder Report</strong></h4>

<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h4>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. They will be accumulating their insights about that circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably quite a few weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached. 
<ul>
</ul>
From the Interests exercise they should get some great insights for the "Be Your Best" file because they will have identified their interests. They will also be receiving their 2nd direct recommendations that can be used in the "Right Careers" file.

<h1><strong>Optional Personal Usage</strong></h1>
Below are two examples that can be of value to an Adviser or Career Advisory Board Member if you want to use the MyRightCareer System for your own life. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use. You will notice Matt and Bud's formats are slightly different than the students.

<h2><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>
Your Next Steps should be:

	<li>Look at an example close to your students profile. That will give you a good idea of what your student's final output should resemble.</li>

	<li>See if your student needs any help while they are completing the exercise.</li>

	<li>Check to see their progress via the Exercise Checklist. If they don't already have it you should suggest it as a good tool for communicating their status.</li>

	<li>Once they complete this exercise, review it and then have your dialogue</li>

	<li>Provide me feedback on any insights you have on the student and the Program, as well as any insights on your Adviser role.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>
We would like your feed back on the Exercise. We would also like your feedback on the Adviser role, your interaction with your student and the support we are providing you.

We would like you to take the SurveyMonkey survey in this section after you finish your work with your student. Most of the feedback in this survey asks you to agree or disagree with a statement. You have five levels of agreement: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree. Besides that you will have a chance to provide free form textual input.

You can also provide feedback by sending Don an email (Don@My-Right-Career.com) or calling him at 650-400-8929.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples this Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>0) Introduction</strong></h3>
One of the more important elements in identifying your Right Career is recognizing the skills you have that you really enjoy using. If you enjoy doing something you will usually do it really well, allowing you to Be Your Best. Those skills will most likely be ones for which you have a Passion. They may also be ones which have Meaning for you.
<ul>
</ul>
O*NET Skills Search is designed to help you use your skill set to identify occupations for exploration. You select a set of skills from six broad groups of skills to create your customized skill list. If you want more instructions on the O*NET Skills System click on "0 - Introduction" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>1) Select Your Skills</strong></h3>
<strong>All Your Skills</strong>: Click on <a href="http://www.onetonline.org/skills/" target="_blank">O*NET Skills Search</a> to start your Skills evaluation. Once you have identified your skills print that file to a pdf so you can save it. We suggest you name it YourName-Skills-All. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-All.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Skills</a> to see the pdf file Edward created from his Skills Search.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>Skills You Enjoy Using</strong>: Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-Enjoy.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Skills he Enjoys.</a> Once you have identified the skills you enjoy using, print that file to a pdf so you can save it. We suggest you name it YourName-Skills-Enjoy. 
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the Full Instructions click on "Step 1 - Select Your Skills" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2) Identify the Occupations that use your Skills</strong></h3>
When you have finished entering the "Skills You Enjoy" click on the Go button at the bottom of the Skills section. Your selected skills are compared to skill ratings for each occupation. If a selected skill is rated "Important" for a particular occupation, it is considered a match. 
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-Enjoy_Occupations-List.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Occupations Suggested</a> and see which Occupations the system suggests for Edward's Skills he enjoys using (he did the yellow highlighting, not O*NET).
<ul>
</ul>
Now create a report for each Occupation of interest showing the skills required. Below are reports showing which of Edward's skills are used for each of those Occupations:

- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Chief-Executives-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Chief Executives</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-TreasurersControllers-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Treasurers and Controllers</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Lawyers-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Lawyers</a>
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the Full Instructions click on "2 - Occupation/Skills Match" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3) Review Specific Occupations</strong></h3>
Now you are going to take a deeper look at Occupations that interest you. As mentioned earlier Edward is trying to decide what he does after graduation from engineering school - work as an engineer, go get an MBA (to work in business) or go to Law School. To help him understand the business and law areas he looked at the following in more depth:

- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Chief-Executives-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Chief Executives</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-TreasurersControllers-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Treasurers and Controllers</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Lawyers-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Lawyers</a>
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the Full Instructions click on "Step 3 - Review Specific Occupations" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4) Create Insights</strong></h3>
It is time to document what you have learned from examining your skills and potential Occupations. Edward is trying to decide if he should go out and work as an engineer, go get an MBA or go get a Law degree. 

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills_Insights.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's Skills Insights</a> to see his conclusions.
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the Full Instructions click "Step 4 - Creating Insights" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h3>
These five documents are examples of the insights obtained from completing all the exercises except Economic Engine: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories and Drivers. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MyRC-RightCareer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Edward-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Edward's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise.

If you want to see the Full Instructions click on "Step 6 - MyRightCareer Insights" in the Sub Navigation Menu on the right.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should watch the Welcome to Skills video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as you do this exercise:
<h4><strong>Autobiography</strong></h4>
Make sure they don't get carried away and write a true Autobiography. It should just be an outline.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-Autobiography.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography</a>
<h4><strong>Transitions</strong></h4>
At their age they should have made a lot of transitions because every thing they do is new, e.g. going from one elementary school to middle school, going from for fun soccer to serious soccer. There are a lot of insights that can come from these transitions.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's Autobiography Insights</a>
<h4><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents</strong></h4>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. They should have taken all of their findings in this exercise and placed them in the appropriate document - Be Your Best, Meaning/Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. They will be accumulating their insights about each circle as they finish each exercise. This makes it easier for them to draw conclusions during the Capstone Project - which is probably quite a few weeks away. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached. A lot of time all they have to do is copy the insights from documents they have already created during the exercise, e.g. there is an insights document for their Age 30 Vision.

<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Example</strong></h1>
Below is an example that can help you understand the Exercise. There are more Experienced Adult examples at the end of the Examples page, which you can access from the Sub Navigation Panel on the right.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills.pdf" target="_blank">Skills List</a> Bud used the same O*NET system the college students use to identify his skills, i.e. he picked them from the list provided by the O*NET system.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills-Occupations-List.pdf" target="_blank">Occupations List</a> The O*NET system then produced a list of Occupations that use those skills. The list starts with the occupations that use the most of his skills and then goes down. Bud highlighted in yellow the occupations of most interest to him.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-Matched.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Skills Required vs. Bud's Skills</a> The O*NET System produces a report showing the skills required for the CEO role and then shows which of those Bud has. There is a similar report for the Treasurer-Controller role. One of the skills Bud lacks for both roles is Active Listening.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Summary Report</a> The O*NET System has a comprehensive report for each Occupation. It has links at the end to other information about that Occupation.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Insights</a> Bud created his insights from this exercise

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-Autobiography.pdf" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: 2em; color: #333333;">Optional Usage by Adviser</strong></a>

To get started using the MyRightCareer System for your own career click on the "Experienced Adult" heading in the Sub Navigation panel on the right.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have two tasks to complete in this step. First you must use the O*NET Skills Search system to identify your skills. Second you need to decide which of those skills are the ones you really enjoy using.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>O*NET Skills</strong></h1>

<h3>Click on <strong><a href="http://www.onetonline.org/skills/" target="_blank">O*NET Skills Search</a></strong></h3>  
<ul>
</ul>
Skills Search is designed to help you use your skill set to identify occupations for exploration. You select a set of skills from six broad groups of skills to create your customized skill list. 
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ONET-Skills-Search-List.pdf" target="_blank">O*NET Skills List</a> to see the Groups and skills within each group.
<ul>
</ul>
Once you have identified your skills print that file to a pdf so you can save it. We suggest you name it YourName-Skills-All.  
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-All.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Skills</a> to see the pdf file Edward created from his Skills Search.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Identify Skills You Enjoy</strong></h1>

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-Enjoy_All_Highligted.pdf" target="_blank">Edward highlighting the skills he enjoys.</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
He has highlighted the skills from the list above he feels he really enjoys using. You will notice he did not highlight all of the skills he feels he has. You may find you enjoy using all of the skills you have, Casey does so she didn't create a Skills she enjoys list. 

You don't have to actually highlight your skills. Instead you can just remove the checkmarks on the skills you have, but don't really enjoy using, and create a new Skills List. 
<ul>
</ul>
Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-Enjoy.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Skills he Enjoys.</a> 
<ul>
</ul>
Once you have identified the skills you enjoy using, print that file to a pdf so you can save it. We suggest you name it YourName-Skills-Enjoy. 
<ul>
</ul>
The rest of the Skills Exercise is based on the Skills you enjoy using. You are more likely to do well when you are using Skills you enjoy. You are more likely to have passion for Skills you enjoy using.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 2 - Occupation/Skills Match</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/skills-strengths/skills/step-2-skills/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
In this Step you are going to 1) Have the system identify some Occupations that use your skills and 2) Examine which skills are used in those Occupations. At the end of this Step you should have a couple of Occupations you want to explore some more.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Occupations/Skills Match</strong></h1>

When you have finished identifying the "Skills You Enjoy" you click on the <strong>Go</strong> button at the bottom of the Skills section. Your selected skills are compared to skill ratings for each occupation. If a selected skill is rated "Important" for a particular occupation, it is considered a match. "Important" includes skills rated 50 or above on the standardized scale (3.0 or above on the original importance scale). Occupations matching all your selected skills are shown first, followed by those matching all but one of your selected skills, and so on. Occupations are presented that match at least 75% of your selected skills.

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills-Enjoy_Occupations-List.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Occupations Suggested</a> and see which Occupations the system suggests for Edward's Skills he enjoys using. He is trying to decide if he should go work as an engineer, go get an MBA or go to Law School. 

His top two Occupations use 12 of the 12 skills he enjoys using: 
- Chief Executives (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, COO, General Manager, Exec VP, Vice President)

- Treasurers and Controllers (e.g., Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Comptroller, Controller,
Director of Finance, Finance Vice President, Treasurer)

Edward is also interested in two other Occupations: IT and Law. They both use 11 of the 12 skills he enjoys using.
- Computer and Information Systems Managers (e.g., IT Director, IS Director, IT Manager)

- Lawyers (e.g., Attorney, Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, City Attorney, County Attorney, Partner, Assistant Counsel)

But both of these occupations are rated as Job Zone 4 instead of Job Zone 5 like Chief Executives and Treasurers/Controllers. The Job Zone tells you how much education, experience and training is required to hold a job with that Zone Level (5 is the highest).
<ul>
</ul>
Edward experimented and used his full Skills list to see if it changed the Occupations suggested. Changing from Skills-All to Skills-Enjoy only made a difference where those four occupations showed up on the Occupations list.

- Chief Executives (still #1 on both lists)
- Treasurers and Controllers (#9 to #2)
- Information Systems Managers (#23 to #10)
- Lawyers (Page 4 to Page 3). 

In each case the occupations of interest move up on the scale by using Skills he enjoys.

So in Edward's case limiting his skills to the ones he enjoys using validates that business (Chief Executives & Treasurers and Controllers) is a good area for him. It shows that working in an IT area (Information Systems Managers) is a good fit as well. It says being a Lawyer gets better, but is still way out on page 3. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Skills Used in Occupations</strong></h1>
Below are reports showing which of Edward's skills are used for each of those Occupations:

- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Chief-Executives-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Chief Executives</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-TreasurersControllers-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Treasurers and Controllers</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Lawyers-Skills-Matched.pdf"target="_blank">Lawyers</a>

For example, the Treasurers and Controllers occupation shows that Edward has the majority of the skills that are rated as important for that Occupation. As he looks at the Occupation he likes that it uses a lot of the skills he enjoys.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Now you are going to take a deeper look at some Occupations of interest to you.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Occupation Summary Reports</strong></h1>

As mentioned earlier Edward is trying to decide what he does after graduation from engineering school - work as an engineer, go get an MBA (to work in business) or go to Law School. To help him understand the business and law areas he looked at the following in more depth:

- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Chief-Executives-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Chief Executives</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-TreasurersControllers-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Treasurers and Controllers</a>
- <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Lawyers-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf"target="_blank">Lawyers</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Report Sections</strong></h1>
There are many different sections in the Summary Report. Below are some important ones.

<h5><strong>Tasks</strong></h5>
Here you can compare the tasks you will be performing in each occupation.

<h5><strong>Knowledge</strong></h5>
Here you can see what types of knowledge you will need to acquire. There is a big difference between the knowledge for Lawyers and Treasurers/Controllers, although there is more overlap than you would think.

<h5><strong>Skills</strong></h5>
This is a repeat of the skills that are important to this Occupation. You should find most of them are ones you enjoy using, which is why this Occupation is on your list.

<h5><strong>Job Zone</strong></h5>
A Job Zone is a group of occupations that are similar in: how much education people need to do the work, how much related experience people need to do the work, and how much on-the-job training people need to do the work. Job Zone 1 needs little preparation and Job Zone 5 needs extensive. Both Chief Executives and Treasurers/Controllers are Zone 5.

<h5><strong>Interests</strong></h5>
This uses the Strong Interest Inventory codes. For example Treasurers/Controllers Interest Code is CE (Conventional and Enterprising). Edward's Code is ECS (Enterprising, Conventional and Social). Thus this Occupation is a good match for his Interests.

<h5><strong>Income/Employment</strong></h5>
You can find out the Median Wages and projected employment growth.

<h5><strong>Related Occupations</strong></h5>
There are often other Occupations that will use similar skills.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
It is time to document what you have learned from examining your skills and potential Occupations.
<h1><strong>Insights</strong></h1>
You can examine multiple areas.
<h5><strong>Skills (All vs. Enjoy) Insights</strong></h5>
Were you surprised at your skills list? Were you able to define them easily? How many skills did you drop to get to your Skills Enjoyed list?
<h5><strong>Skill/Occupation Insights</strong></h5>
Do the Occupations the Skills System recommends seem to make sense to you? If you look at a particular Occupation do the Skills required make sense?
<h5><strong>Occupations Themselves</strong></h5>
What did you learn by examining the Summary Report for any particular occupation?
<h1><strong>Edward Insights Example</strong></h1>
Edward is trying to decide if he should go out and work as an engineer, go get an MBA or go get a Law degree. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Edward-Skills_Insights.pdf" target="_blank">Edward's Skills Insights</a>

<em>"A lot of the Skills I enjoy using are analytical, which coincides with my INTJ personality. It is also the reason I went to engineering school in the first place. But as I found out those same skills lend themselves to other Occupations than engineering."</em>

His skills pointed to business Occupations as the best fit - his top two Occupations use 12 of the 12 skills he enjoys using. Those two Occupations are listed #1 and #2 on his list.

- Chief Executives (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, COO, General Manager, Exec VP, Vice President)

- Treasurers and Controllers (e.g., Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Comptroller, Controller,
Director of Finance, Finance Vice President, Treasurer)

The Lawyers Occupation ends up on Page 3.

The Skills exercise says getting an MBA to prepare for a business career is probably a better use of Edward's skills than going to Law School to prepare for a legal career.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: "Be Your Best", "Meaning & Passion", "Fuel Your Economic Engine", "Right Opportunity" and "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Casey Examples</strong></h1>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography, Accomplishments,  Strengths, Skills, Meaning (Stories, Drivers, How will you Measure your Life) and Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how she has added insights with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights obtained from completing all the exercises except Economic Engine: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories and Drivers. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> You have now identified your Skills, some of them are related to your natural personality and strengths. You should be able to find a lot of insights.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are there areas where you interests and your passion intersect? It is very normal for you to find meaning and have passion when you are using Skills you enjoy using.

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your Skills to fuel you economic engine. 

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> What Occupations did you identify? 

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> What types of environments most interest you. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared your O*NET Skills report. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Skills</strong> Share your Skills - the entire list and the ones you enjoy using.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Occupations:</strong> Discuss the Occupations O*NET suggest for those skills.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Specific Occupations:</strong> Choose a couple of occupations and talk about them.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Skills Insights:</strong> Explain the insights you have gained about which Skills you have and which you enjoy. Also explain the relationship between these skills and potential Occupations.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents::</strong> These are the most important documents you will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. These documents must be discussed.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done seven exercises and you should have a handle on the schedule by now.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> Most likely you have now settled into a process that works for the two of you, e.g. how you communicate, how you review.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these exercises.</li>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the same process we used in the previous exercises.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: Skills You Enjoyed, Occupations and your Insights document.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>C) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 1 - StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/skills-strengths/strenght/step-1/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>

You need to do an assessment before you can do the actual exercises (which use the outputs of the assessment). 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assessment Access - Your Career Center</strong></h1>
Once the system reaches Beta Test the students will have to take all their Assessments (i.e. Myers-Briggs, Do What You Are, Strong Interest Inventory and StrengthsFinder 2.0) through their Career Center.

During this Alpha Test we want to test how well this works by having you go to your Career Center for these Assessments. For this exercise we would like you to see if your Career Center offers the StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment. If so please take it through the Career Center and then use the output to finish this exercise.

If you watched either (or both) of the Marcus Buckingham videos you know focusing on leveraging your Strengths is one of secrets of success. You may not realize it has been embraced by a large number of very successful companies. Your Career Center may not realize this and you could suggest they pay for you to take the Assessment as a way for them to experiment (for only $10) with the Strengths movement.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Assessment Access - No Career Center Support</strong></h1>
If your Career Center does not or will not support the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment you need to purchase the access code via the Gallup Strengths Center. The cost of this assessment is $9.
<ul>
</ul>
In that case you need to tell Don you were not able to take the assessments through your Career Center and some of the reasons why not. We would like to understand the problems of taking these assessments via the student's Career Center. Don will then email you the $10.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment</strong></h1>
Click on link below to the Gallup Strengths Center. You are going to take the "Strengths Discovery Package".
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Purchase/"target="_blank">Gallup Strengths Center</a></h4></li>
<ul>
</ul>
What you are purchasing is a unique access code to the StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment. You will use that Access Code to register and set up an ID (your email) and Password. Then you will take the assessment and you will be able to download a pdf file containing your personal StrengthsFinder 2.0 Report. The assessment takes about 45 minutes and you need to finish it in one sitting.

You can come back to the Web site as often as you wish to retrieve that report again or look at other Strength related resources.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Section II - Ideas for Action</strong></h1> 
In the StrengthsFinder2 Report (Section II - Action Planning Guide) there are 10 Recommended Actions you can take for each of your Five Top Talents.
<ul>
</ul>
For an example click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-Action-Planning-Guide.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Action Planning Guide</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Personalize your Ideas for Action</strong></h1> 
	<li>Pick two or three of the 10 Ideas for Action for each of your top five themes that you would like to implement during the next year. Take a highlighter and mark those Ideas for Action. If you have Adobe Acrobat you can annotate the electronic file like Casey did <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Casey-Action-Planning-Guide-Annotated.pdf" target="_blank">Annotated Ideas for Actions</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Create a one page summary of what you have learned by looking at all your Ideas for Action. If you picked three for each of your Top 5 Talents you will have 30 Ideas for Action.

		<title>Step 4 - Add to MyRightCareer Insights-Strengths</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/skills-strengths/strenght/step-4/</link>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=6362</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-RightCareeer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> You have now identified a lot of your interests, some of them are related to your natural personality and strengths. Add insights you have gained to this file. You should be able to find a lot of insights, just like Casey did.

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are there areas where you interests and your passion intersect? Casey found a lot of these. It is very normal for you to find meaning and have passion for things that interest you.

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your interests to fuel you economic engine. Do you see how your interests may cause you to require more fuel.

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> What careers and jobs did you identify? You should have found some in the Strong Interest Inventory report and some more in the Strong and Myers-Briggs report.

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> What types of environments most interest you. The Strong Theme & Myers-Briggs Type provides some good clues on your preferred work environment. The Strong Personal Style & Myers-Briggs Preferences provides insights on how you like to work.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 5 - Discuss with Adviser-Strengths</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now it is time to discuss your results with your Adviser. You may have been communicating with them along the way so they may already know some of what you have done, e.g. you might have shared your StrenghtsFinder report. But assuming you have not shared anything here are the suggested items to share and discuss:
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Content Issues</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>StrengthsFinder Report</strong> Share your Top Five Talents and some of the key findings from the StrengthsFinder Report.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Strengths/Talents Insights:</strong> Help them understand, from your viewpoint, the insights you have gained into your Talents/Strengths and their influence on your Career.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Strengths Ideas for Action:</strong> Explain some of the main Ideas for Action you have chosen and why you chose them.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Ideas for Action Insights:</strong> Explain what the Ideas for Action has helped you understand about your Talents/Strengths.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents::</strong> These are the most important documents you will be creating during the program. There is one document for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram. These documents must be discussed.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Process Issues</strong></h1>
These last items are process oriented issues:
	<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> You have now done seven exercises and you should have a handle on the schedule by now.</li>

	<li><strong>Adviser Review Process:</strong> Most likely you have now settled into a process that works for the two of you, e.g. how you communicate, how you review.</li>

	<li><strong>Anything else you want to discuss:</strong> Who knows what has come up in doing these exercises.</li>]]></content:encoded>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>A) Send your completed exercises to Don</strong></h1>
Send all of your completed material for this exercise to Don: StrengthsFinder Report, Strengths/Talents Insights, Strengths Ideas for Action and Ideas for Action Insights.

He will review it and remove anything he feels would disclose your personal identity, e.g. names of friends, high school name, college name. He will conform the file names, headings, etc to the standards used on all the other examples (if you used the templates this will not require much work). He will append your "stage name" to the front of all of the files.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>B) Review and comment on Don's Exercise files</strong></h1>
Don will send you the proposed exercise files. You should review them and suggest any changes you would like made, e.g. drop this information, reword this information.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>C) Don will load your Example on Examples page</strong></h1>
He will add these examples to your section on the Examples page. Individual pieces of your example may be integrated into the Full Instructions. As Don gets more examples he will use examples he feels do a good job explaining key ideas. Your example may be used on Exercise #2 and then not again until Exercise #4 and #5.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Accomplishments Approach</strong></h1>
You are looking at your accomplishments for three reasons. First so you can pull together a comprehensive list of your accomplishments. Second so you can identify the accomplishments you really enjoyed doing because it would be great if your career had more of these types of experiences. Third so you identify accomplishments you did not really enjoy doing because it would be great if your career was not made up of a lot of these types of accomplishments.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<h3><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/MyRC-4-Accomplishments.wmv" target="_blank">Welcome to the Accomplishments Exercise</a></h3>

Click on the link above to see a video where Don explains your Exercise via some examples. 

At the conclusion of the video close the Windows Media Player, then close the page it was running in and you will return to this page.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Instructions</strong></h1>
You need to: 1) Create a list of all of your accomplishments, 2) Create a list of 3 to 10 accomplishments you really enjoyed doing and 2 to 3 accomplishments you did not enjoy doing, 3) Document the insights you gained from the exercise, 4) Add to your MyRightCareer Insights, 5) Provide feedback, 6) Discuss your completed exercise with your Facilitator and 7) Become an Example. None of the steps take longer than one hour. Steps 1 through 4 will probably take you about 2 hours.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Step 8 - 2nd Career Advisory Board Meeting</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Now is time to share the results of your final three Assignments: Strengths (Skills & Talents/Strengths), Meaning/Passion (Stories, Drivers, How to Measure Your Life & Meaning Insights) and Economic Engine with your Career Advisory Board. At this point you will have completed all six Insights Assignments so it is important to get as much guidance and insight from the Board as you can.
<ul>
</ul>
You should proceed with the next Capstone Assignment while you are having discussions with your Career Advisory Board members. Due to schedule conflicts it could take several weeks to complete this step and you can be working on Capstone Assignment in parallel.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss Your MyRightCareer Insights</strong></h1>

At the minimum you need to send them your five MyRightCareer Insights files from your last  exercise (Economic Engine): Be Your Best, Meaning & Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. 
<ul>
</ul>
For each area, e.g. Be Your Best, you should  have a dialogue about what you have discovered about yourself relative to that element in the Right Career Venn diagram. You should also have a discussion about what you have learned about yourself as a Whole Person, the fifth file.
<ul>
</ul>
Here are Casey's as an example, except they have insights for all of the exercises:

		<title>Step 6 - 3rd Career Advisory Board Meeting</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/capstone/step-5/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2013 02:35:20 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/?page_id=6670</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Now is time to share your Right Career (s), your Sales Story for that Right Career (s) and your Follow-on Plan with your Career Advisory Board.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Right Career</strong></h1>

Share with them the Right Career (s) you identified and why. For example Casey identified her Right Career as: 

	<li><strong>Function</strong>: Director of Marketing and Public Relations</li>
	<li><strong>Industry</strong>: Apparel, specifically consignment/vintage stores</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong>: Major Cities, e.g. Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City</li>
<ul>
</ul>
She had created the following two files to support that choice and shared them with the Board:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Summary.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Summary (2 Pages)</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Right_Career-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Right Career - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
You want to engage each of them in a discussion about your logic for your choice.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Sales Story</strong></h1>

Share with them your two versions of your Sales Story - a full version (greater than one page) and an Elevator Version (less than one page)
<ul>
</ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Sales_Story.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Sales Story (2 pages)</a></li>

 	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Sales_Story-Elevator.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Sales Story - Elevator Statement (3/4 Page)</a>
<ul>
</ul>
Point out to them that the Sales Story (2 pages) file and the Right Career (2 pages) files are very similar. They both contain the basic same information because the career that is right for you is also the one in which you will most likely be successful. The Sales Story (2 pages) version is written in a more pro active voice.

You want to engage each of them in a discussion about your Sales Story - what is missing, what should be dropped, what should be strengthened.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Your Follow-on Plan</strong></h1>
Now share with them your Follow-on Plan. Think about incorporating one or two Career Advisory Board Meetings in that Follow-on Plan. It is a great way to ensure you will carry out the plan. It will also keep your Board members engaged with you and your success.

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Casey-Follow_on_Plan.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Follow-on Plan</a></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Discuss What is Next</strong></h1>
You should ask them if they will help you stay on track as you implement your Follow-on Plan. Ideally you will have built-in some checkpoints where it would make sense to get their input. ]]></content:encoded>

<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Test Bilbo

&nbsp;

As an Intern you will be using the MyRightCareer system differently depending on the type of Internship you are completing. Find your Internships below and read the Guidance before proceeding.
<h1><strong>Program Usage and Content Internships</strong></h1>
The Program Usage &amp; Content category has three Internships (Total Program, Assignment and Content Development), as well as the opportunity to design your own Custom Internship.

There are several things in common to all of these Program Usage &amp; Content Internships:
<ul>
	<li>You are actually using the MyRightCareer system, not filling a role in Marketing, Development or Company Management.</li>
	<li>You are providing feedback on each exercise through a SurveyMonkey survey</li>
	<li>You are allowing Don to use your exercise output as a potential example</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Total Program Internship</strong></h5>
The Total Program Internship requires you to complete the entire MyRightCareer Program: the Pre-Requisite Assignment, all 6 Insight Assignments and the Capstone Assignment.

While the MyRightCareer Program is totally self-paced, so you can determine your own schedule, it is recommended you plan on a 12 week schedule. Thus you are making a major time commitment by signing up for the Total Program Internship, i.e. 50 hours over 12 weeks.

You must also recruit a Team to help you (an Adviser/Facilitator and Career Advisory Board). Thus you are not only committing your time, you are asking others to commit their time and coordinate schedules with you for reviews.
<h5><strong>Assignment Internship</strong></h5>
The Assignment Internship requires you to complete a set of three related Insights Assignments, out of the 6 Insights Assignments in the MyRightCareer Program and will probably take 18 to 24 hours to complete. You will be completing the Pre-Requisite, Begin at the End and two Assignments chosen by Don &amp; you together.

You do not have to recruit a team (Adviser/Facilitator and Career Advisory Board) so you are not committing anyone’s time, nor do you have to coordinate schedules with them. This means you do not have to complete those exercises in the Pre-Requisites Assignment.
<h5><strong>Content Strategy Internship</strong></h5>
The Content Strategy Internship requires you to improve the overall content strategy for the entire program or the improvement of at least one Assignment (which usually contains two Exercises). The Strategy improvement may take forms very similar to those of an individual exercise, but be designed to apply to all the exercises, e.g. instructions, examples, templates, exercise flow, Short vs. Full Instructions, general feedback, SurveyMonkey questions &amp; feedback, other feedback, use of YouTube/video’s, use of Facebook,and many others. This area can include recommendations to add Exercises or drop Exercises.

Alternately you can contribute to the improvement of at least one Assignment (which usually contains two Exercises). The improvement can take many forms of improvements, e.g. instructions, examples, templates, exercise flow, Short vs. Full Instructions, general feedback, SurveyMonkey questions &amp; feedback, other feedback, use of YouTube/video’s, use of Facebook,and many others.

You do not have to recruit a team (Adviser/Facilitator and Career Advisory Board) so you are not committing anyone’s time, nor do you have to coordinate schedules with them. This means you do not have to complete those exercises in the Pre-Requisites Assignment, unless you have chosen to focus on the Adviser and/or Career Advisory Board as the area you hope to improve.
<h1><strong>Marketing and Sales Internships</strong></h1>
There are a wide range of Internships in this category, e.g. Marketing Strategy, Web-based Marketing, Social media, Product Management, Competition, Sales and Recruitment.
<h5><strong>Common Tasks for All Marketing Internships</strong></h5>
There are several things in common to all of the Marketing Internships:
<ul>
	<li>You are only using the MyRightCareer system to gain an appreciation of it so you can be effective in your Internship. You will be completing the Pre-Requisite, Begin at the End and two Assignments chosen by Don &amp; you together.</li>
	<li>You do not have to recruit a team (Adviser/Facilitator and Career Advisory Board) so you are not committing anyone’s time, nor do you have to coordinate schedules with them. This means you do not have to complete those exercises in the Pre-Requisites Assignment.</li>
	<li>You are providing feedback on each exercise you complete, through a SurveyMonkey survey</li>
	<li>You are allowing Don to use your exercise output as a potential example</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Missing Pre-Requisite Exercises</strong></h5>
While you can complete the Insights Assignment in any order you want it is recommended you complete them in the order they are shown across the top of the page: Future --&gt; Self --&gt; Past --&gt; Strengths --&gt; Meaning --&gt; Economics.

If you do them out of order or the two Assignments from Don are later in the sequence, there is a simple solution. In the instructions for the following Exercises, where this problem occurs, there will be guidance for fulfilling the pre-requisite: Strengths Assignment (Skills Exercise), Meaning Assignment (Stories Exercise), Economic Engine Assignment (Age 30 Budget Exercise).

For example, to complete the Age 30 Budget Exercise you only have to complete, from the Begin at the End Assignment, "Step 1 - Visualize your self at Age 30", not all four steps in the Begin at the End exercise.
<h1><strong>Development Internships</strong></h1>
There are a wide range of Internships in this category, e.g.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Marketing site</strong>: Technology and Marketing site-Ease of Use &amp; Other</li>
	<li><strong>Content site</strong>: Technology, Content site-eLearning Platform, Content site-Ease of Use and Content site-Commerce.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Common Tasks for All Development Internships</strong></h5>
There are several things in common to all of the Development Internships:
<ul>
	<li>You are only using the MyRightCareer system to gain an appreciation of it so you can be effective in your Internship. You will be completing the Pre-Requisite, Begin at the End and two Assignments chosen by Don &amp; you together.</li>
	<li>You do not have to recruit a team (Adviser/Facilitator and Career Advisory Board) so you are not committing anyone’s time, nor do you have to coordinate schedules with them. This means you do not have to complete those exercises in the Pre-Requisites Assignment.</li>
	<li>You are providing feedback on each exercise you complete, through a SurveyMonkey survey</li>
	<li>You are allowing Don to use your exercise output as a potential example</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Missing Pre-Requisite Exercises</strong></h5>
While you can complete the Insights Assignment in any order you want it is recommended you complete them in the order they are shown across the top of the page: Future --&gt; Self --&gt; Past --&gt; Strengths --&gt; Meaning --&gt; Economics.

If you do them out of order or the two Assignments from Don are later in the sequence, there is a simple solution. In the instructions for the following Exercises, where this problem occurs, there will be guidance for fulfilling the pre-requisite: Strengths Assignment (Skills Exercise), Meaning Assignment (Stories Exercise), Economic Engine Assignment (Age 30 Budget Exercise).

For example, to complete the Age 30 Budget Exercise you only have to complete, from the Begin at the End Assignment, "Step 1 - Visualize your self at Age 30", not all four steps in the Begin at the End exercise.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>MyRightCareer Insights-Stories</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/meaningsummar/stories/myrcinsights/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-BeYourBest-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Be Your Best" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-MeaningPassion-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Meaning & Passion" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-EconomicEngine-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Economic Engine" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-RightCareeer-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Right Career" Insights</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Casey-MyRC-WholePerson-Insights_Final.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's "Whole Person" Insights</a>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> Do any of your stories show when you are at your Best? Add insights you have gained to this file. 

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> You were asked to write stories about accomplishments you really enjoyed doing. Are there areas where your accomplishments and your passion intersect?

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your meaning/passion to fuel you economic engine. Do you see how it may cause you to pursue a career (s) that don't pay very well.

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> Did you identify any careers and jobs? Maybe a story reminded you how much you enjoyed something that you have since dropped.

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> Your stories probably give you some good insights into Whole Person issues.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
If you remember from the previous exercises, there are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Opportunity" and one for "Whole Person". Each file has a section for you to record your insights after you complete each exercise. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program you will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist you in identifying your Right Career and preparing your Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<strong>MyRightCareer Insights</strong> These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Personality, Interests, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How Will You Measure Your Life and Fuel Your Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how insights were added with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<h1><strong>Update your MyRightCareer Insights Documents</strong></h1>
Take your existing MyRightCareer Insights documents and add the insights you have gained from this exercise. Remember you only have one file for each of the four circles in the Venn diagram and then a fifth file for the Whole Person. You do not create new MyRightCareer Insights files for each exercise. Instead you are adding insights on top of the insights from the previous exercise. Within each file are the headings for the Exercises to make this easy. You can see this by looking at Casey’s examples above.

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> Are any of your Drivers the base for your achievements? Add insights you have gained to this file. 

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> Are the things that are your Drivers also things that have meaning to you and for which you have passion?

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> Do you see how you can leverage your Drivers to fuel you economic engine. Do you see how it may cause you to pursue a career (s) that don't pay very well.

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> Did you identify any careers and jobs? Your Drivers may point you toward certain type of roles or types of industries.

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> Your Drivers are not just about work. ]]></content:encoded>

Be sure to add insights to each of the documents: 

- <strong>Be Your Best:</strong> The first question should help with this insight area (How can I be sure I will be successful and happy in my career?) 

- <strong>Meaning & Passion:</strong> The second and third questions should provide insights for this area (How can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse, my children, my extended family and close friends become an enduring source of happiness? How can I live a life of integrity — and stay out of jail?)

- <strong>Fuel your Economic Engine:</strong> The first question should help with this insight area (How can I be sure I will be successful and happy in my career?). How much of that is measured in dollars? The second question should provide insights for this area (How can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse, my children, my extended family and close friends become an enduring source of happiness?) - they provide happiness but they also require financial resources. The third question should provide insights for this area (How can I live a life of integrity — and stay out of jail?)  If you don't stay out of jail you will not provide much fuel. 

- <strong>Right Opportunities:</strong> Doesn't a Right Opportunity allow you to answer all three questions?

- <strong>Whole Person:</strong> All three questions have Whole Person ramifications.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 - Program Approach</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/getting-started/2-program-approach/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You may identify your Right Career or Careers after completing only three of the Insights Assignments. It just all falls together and you say "Yes, that is what I should be doing".

This can happen no matter which of the two approaches described below, College Course or Cafeteria, you choose.
<a href="http://myplanb.org/?attachment_id=777"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-777" title="Analysis &amp; Intuition" alt="" src="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Analytical-vs-Intuitive.pdf" width="300" height="300" /></a>
The Assignments (and the Exercises within them) are not going to magically tell you what is your Right Career. 
<ul>
</ul>
You are going to start to recognize that through Intuition. The diagram at the left graphically shows you start out with the emphasis heavily on Analysis. As you finish the Assignments across the bottom your Intuition should be taking over.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Course Approach</strong></h1>
A good way to start is to envision the MyRightCareer Program as a college course. If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MyRC-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">Program Schedule</a> you will get a pdf file showing the recommend order for the Assignments and a suggested time line.

The recommended order for completing the Assignments is their position across the top of the Web page. Some of the later Exercises require information generated in the earlier exercises, e.g. to complete the Age 30 Budget Exercise you need your Age 30 Vision from the Begin at the End Exercise. 

It is recommended you follow a 12 week schedule for completing the MyRightCareer Program, assuming you want to finish quickly. The Program is totally self-paced so you can determine your own schedule - you can finish it in less elapsed time or take longer. The 12 week schedule made the following assumptions:
<ul>
</ul>

	<li>1 week for Prerequisites</li>
	<li>8 weeks for six Insights Assignments (average of 4.7 hours/week)</li>
	<li>3 weeks for Capstone Project (average of 3.3 hours/week)</li>
<ul>
</ul>
The bulk of the work is completing the six Insights Assignments which contain 13 Exercises. Each Exercise takes about 3 hours to complete. Each Exercise has multiple Steps and no Step is longer than 1 hour so you can work on this in 1 hour or shorter increments. You may find you can finish the Exercises faster than I estimated and thus finish the entire Program sooner than my 12 week schedule.
<ul>
</ul> 
If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MyRC-Schedule.xlsx" target="_blank">Program Schedule Template - Excel</a> you will get the Excel version. It is the sample schedule, except in Excel so you can create your own schedule. It uses movable red boxes to represent the schedule.You can move the red boxes around - there are one week, two week and three week boxes.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Cafeteria Approach</strong></h1>
You don't have to do the Assignments in the recommended order, instead you can complete the ones that you feel will provide the most insights. You might feel the following are the most important for you: Future (Begin at the End), Self (Personality &amp; Interests) and Strengths (Skills &amp; Talents/Strengths).

If you do them out of order you may find you are missing some pre-requisite exercises (e.g. to complete the Age 30 Budget Exercise you need your Age 30 Vision from the Begin at the End Assignment). There is a simple solution to this problem. In the instructions for the Exercises where this problem occurs, there will be guidance for fulfilling the pre-requisite.

Once you feel you have identified your Right Career or Career (s) you should move on to the Capstone Assignment where you will:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Document that Right Career</li>
	<li>Validate your Right Career Choice (s)</li>
	<li>Build a Sales Story</li>
	<li>Create a Follow-on Plan</li>
<ul>
</ul>
If you did not do all of the Assignments there are good reasons to finish them. In the above example the other 3 Insights Assignments allow you:
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>To validate the Right Career you identified after your first 3 Insights Assignments is still the right one for you</li>
	<li>To build a more compelling Sales Story, e.g. in this example: Past (an Autobiography &amp; Accomplishments – useful for Sales Story), Meaning (useful for Sales Story) and Economics (puts some financial reality into your ideas)</li>
	<li>To put some financial reality into your ideas, e.g. Fuel your Economic Engine (Age 30 Budget, Age 22 Budget and Age 22 Non-Professional Budget)</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
No matter how you used the MyRightCareer resources - going through the Program in the recommended order or just doing the Assignments you see as valuable - you should be able to identify your Right Career, Build a compelling Sales Story and Create a Follow-on Plan.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Old Content Strategy</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/contentstrat/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>

The Content Strategy Internship requires you to improve  the overall content strategy for the entire program. The improvement may take forms very similar to those of an individual exercise, but be designed to apply to all the exercises, e.g. instructions, examples, templates, exercise flow, Short vs. Full Instructions, general feedback, SurveyMonkey questions &amp; feedback, other feedback, use of YouTube/video’s, use of Facebook,and many others. This area can include recommendations to add Exercises or drop Exercises.
<ul>
</ul>
Alternately you can contribute to the improvement of at least one Assignment (which usually contains two Exercises). The improvement can take many forms of improvements, e.g. instructions, examples, templates, exercise flow, Short vs. Full Instructions, general feedback, SurveyMonkey questions &amp; feedback, other feedback, use of YouTube/video’s, use of Facebook,and many others.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Improve Content Strategy</strong></h3>
You might decide to explore the Capstone Assignment and its relationship to the six Insights assignments. You might choose to examine how the student is able to glean insights into their Right Career from the six Insights assignments and try to develop a better way to do that. 
<ul>
</ul>
You might explore how the use of YouTube video's could improve the exercises and how that approach could be implemented. This could include creating a sample video for one Exercise.
<h3><strong>Improve an Assignment or Exercise</strong></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
You might examine the "Begin at the End" exercise (one that requires the student to visualize them self at Age 30). Maybe you start with the SurveyMonkey feedback we have already received. You can use your own experience of taking that exercise. Maybe you take it over again, concentrating on ways it can be improved. You find out from Don some people who have taken that exercise and get permission to interview them. From all of this you start to explore ways to improve the exercise. You may come up with approaches that could apply across all of the exercises, as well as to the Begin at the End exercise, e.g. exercise flow, use of videos, types of examples.
<ul>
</ul>
You might choose an excise like Personality that uses the Myers-Briggs Personality Type and explore if there is a better way to leverage that standard test. You might explore all the other tests available in that same area, both from Myers-Briggs and from others in that area.
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You have an opportunity to get assistance from experienced adults to help you find your right career. One where your are being your best because the role plays to your strengths and personality. One where your find meaning and passion in your role and the company's mission. One where you are willing to work 24/7, but it is not really work to you. In that right career you provide a lot of the creative energy in your department. Your enthusiasm is contagious.

It doesn't matter if you are a college student, a recent graduate or an experienced adult using the MyRightCareer System. Almost every major change you try to make in your life (e.g. lose weight, get into better physical shape) has a higher chance of success if you involve others.

That assistance can be provided via two roles: Adviser and/or Career Advisory Board Member. Both of them are described below. At the minimum we recommend you recruit a Career Advisory Board.

<h1><strong>Adviser</strong></h1>
As an Adviser they are more involved than they would be if they were a member of the your Career Advisory Board. As an Adviser they work with your on every Assignment, reviewing output from every Exercise in that Assignment. You will typically meet with them seven times, once for each of the six Insights Assignments and then once after the Capstone Assignment. Most of those reviews will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email.

Visit the<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/getting-started/studentadv/advise/ "> <strong>Adviser</strong></a>. It provides more detail on items such as: What Does an Adviser Do?, What Support are Advisers Provided? and Can an Adviser use MyRightCareer for themselves? If you understand the Adviser Role it will be easy to understand the Career Advisory Board Member role.
<h1><strong>Career Advisory Board Member</strong></h1>
The Career Advisory Board probably never meets as a group. Instead you will meet with each member individually. Most of those meetings will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email. As a Career Advisory Board Member their main role is reviewing output at three different points in the Program: 1st review will be after first three Insights Assignments, 2nd review will be after final three Insights Assignments and the Final Review will be after the Capstone project. Thus they will only be reviewing your work twice during the program so they are a lot less involved than an Adviser.

It provides more detail on items such as: What Does a Board Member Do?, What Support are Members Provided? and Can a Board Member use MyRightCareer for themselves?
<h1><strong>Your Mentors can use this approach</strong></h1>
The MyRightCareer Program is repurposed from the MyPlanB Program Don has been running for several years for people in their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's.

There will be an example of a person more like them for every exercise, along with guidance on how to use that exercise for their life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<strong>Note</strong>: This is written for the adult who the MyRightCareer Program User wants as a mentor (either as an Adviser or as a Career Advisory Board Member).

As you think about your own department, division and company wouldn't you want a bunch of employees who were working at their right careers? Your department would be the most productive and creative department in the company. Your company would be the most productive, profitable and innovative company in the industry.

It doesn't matter if they are a college student, a recent graduate or an experienced adult using the MyRightCareer System. Almost every major change you try to make in your life (e.g. lose weight, get into better physical shape) has a higher chance of success if you involve others.

In your role as a career mentor you can help them in one of two roles: Adviser or Career Advisory Board Member. Both of them are described below. We suggest you focus on the Adviser role for the moment. Once you understand that role it will be easy to understand the difference between being an Adviser and a member of the students Career Advisory Board. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Adviser</strong></h1>
As an Adviser you are more involved than you would be if you were a member of the Program User's Career Advisory Board. As an Adviser you help them design their use of the MyRightCareer System, e.g. which Assignments to complete and the schedule for the work. As an Adviser you work with them on every Insights Assignment they choose to complete. Most of those reviews will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email. In the Adviser role you are hands-on, helping them as they move through the MyRightCareer process.
<ul>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Career Advisory Board Member</strong></h1>
The Career Advisory Board probably never meets as a group. Instead the Program User will meet with each member individually. Most of those meetings will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email. As a Career Advisory Board Member your main role is reviewing output at two different points in the Program: 1st review will be after first three Insights Assignments, 2nd review will be after final three Insights Assignments. You will also have a Final Review after the Capstone project when they present their Right Opportunity, how they Validated it was really their Right Opportunity, their Sales Story and their Follow-on Plan. As a Career Advisory Board Member you are more removed from the MyRightCareer Process than an Adviser.
<ul>

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>You can use this approach for Yourself</strong></h1>
The MyRightCareer Program is repurposed from the MyPlanB Program Don has been running for several years for people in their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's.

There will be an example of a person more like you for every exercise, along with instructions on how to use that exercise for your life. In addition there will be other Experienced Adult examples on the Examples page.

<ul>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Sign Up</strong> 
Talk to the MyRightCareer Program User who approached you, indicating if you are willing to be either an Adviser or a Career Advisory Board member (or both). </li>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
As an Adviser you are more involved than you would be if you were a member of the Program User's Career Advisory Board. As an Adviser you work with them on every Assignment.
<h1><strong>What does an Adviser Do?</strong></h1>
As the Adviser you have three roles.
<h3><strong>Collaboratively Manage the Process:</strong></h3>
First, the two of you manage the process (they drive it).
<ul>
	<li>Together you decide on the approach the Program User should take: College Course or Cafeteria. If they use the College Course approach they will be completing all six Insight Assignments in the order they appear at the top of the screen. If the two of you choose the Cafeteria Approach you will select which of the six Assignments you feel would be most helpful in defining their right career. There is guidance in the PreRequisites Assignment, Course Approach module, for doing this. The Program User could start by doing only three Assignments and see if they can identify their right career. If after those three Assignments they don't feel ready to identify their right career you could then add one or two other Assignments you both think would add some more insights.</li>
	<li>Together you set up the initial schedule. The two of you should create a schedule that takes into account how many Assignments, the student's academic, extracurricular (e.g. sports) and personal realities. It has to also factor your own schedule into the equation. This is entirely a self-paced Program. There is an Excel spreadsheet with a suggested schedule you two can customize.</li>
	<li>There is a Checklist you will be given for each exercise that can be used by both of you to manage the progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Help with the Program Content:</strong></h3>
Second, as an Adviser you can help them with the content of the Program, e.g. discussing how they are identifying their Top 10 Accomplishments. If you are using the MyRightCareer System for your own life and doing the Exercises in parallel with them it should be quite easy to have a dialogue about any exercise - sometimes they ask you for guidance and maybe sometimes you ask them for guidance.
<ul>
	<li>Most of your involvement comes after they complete an Assignment and send you the completed exercises. The most important outputs are the MyRightCareer Insights files. There is one file for each of the circles in the Right Career Venn diagram: Be Your Best, Meaning &amp; Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career (s) and Whole Person. After each exercise the student adds their insights for that exercise to each of the files. You should be reviewing those files after they complete each Assignment.</li>
	<li>Most of those reviews will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Provide Feedback:</strong></h3>
Third, the Adviser can help Don by providing feedback on the program.
<ul>
	<li>Program User issues you observe, e.g. my Program User is having trouble summarizing the Assignment/Exercise information, they doesn't seem to be getting many insights, I think they found their Right Career after only three Assignments.</li>
	<li>Adviser issues, e.g. if you provided me a tool for ABC it would make my job easier.</li>
</ul>
The Adviser can provide the feedback in two different ways: 1) via the Feedback page – there is a Feedback page on every Exercise that contains an on-line Survey, 2) Other – feel free to use whatever is easiest for you, e.g. email, phone.
<h1><strong>Time Required</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Program User</strong></h3>
There are 15 Insights Exercises and 4 Capstone Exercises so the total time estimate for those 19 Exercises (using 2.5 hours/Assignment) is about 50 hours. That would most likely be spread over a 12 week period, but since the Program is entirely self-paced you and your student can work out a mutually acceptable schedule. Below is the logic for this estimate.

If you and your student decide to use the Cafeteria approach and they only complete 3 of the 6 Insights Exercises both of you will invest less time. The amount of time invested nor the number of Assignments completed is not the issue. The goal is to identify the student's right career, validate it, create a sales story and build a follow-on plan.
<h3><strong>Adviser</strong></h3>
Your Program User will most likely ask you to review their exercise output after they complete each Assignment (which typically has two related Exercises, e.g Autobiography and Accomplishments). For every Exercise you will have two types of reviews.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Prior to the Assignment Review Session (1 hour):</strong> Review the exercise output your student sends you - you could take 1/2 hour to 1 1/2 hours reviewing their material.</li>
	<li><strong>During the Assignment Review Session (1 hour):</strong> This is most likely a phone call session - it could last from 1/2 hour to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>What Support are Advisers Provided?</strong></h1>
There will be information that will help the Adviser in two broad ways.
<h3><strong>General Information:</strong></h3>
There is general information such as this page. There are also scheduling and tracking resources.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MyRC-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">Program Schedule Template - pdf</a> you will get the pdf version of a simple Excel scheduling tool. It has a sample that uses movable red boxes to represent the schedule.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MyRC-Schedule.xls" target="_blank">Program Schedule Template - Excel</a> you will get the Excel version. It is the sample schedule, except in Excel so you can create your own schedule. You can move the red boxes around - there are one week, two week and three week boxes.
<h3><strong>Exercise Specific Information:</strong></h3>
There are specific resources for each exercise, e.g.
<ul>
	<li>Experienced Adult Examples
On the Adviser Guidance page there will be an Experienced Adult example so they can see an example more like themselves. In the Examples page there are other Experienced Adult examples.</li>
	<li>Adviser Guidance on each exercise
It will include an Introduction to the Exercise and the Steps the Adviser should be taking with the Program User. It is in the list of Steps for the Exercise and you can also click on any of those Steps to get a full set of Instructions. You can also click on the Short Instructions page for a single page with a few sentences, examples and templates for each Step. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end-full-instructions/adviser/" target="_blank">Adviser Guidance - Begin at the End</a>. and it will open in a new Tab. Once you have reviewed it you can close the Tab.</li>
	<li>Exercise Checklist (used by both the Program User and Adviser).
To see an example of a Checklist click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BeginAtEnd_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Begin at the End Checklist</a> you will get the pdf document that is the Checklist for the sub-exercises in the Begin at the End Exercise. Each of you will have a copy of the same Checklist. There is the native Excel version of this file on the Templates page in the Begin at the End exercise Assignment</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong style="font-size: 1.17em;">Future Adviser Support</strong></h3>
Tools will be improved over time with feedback from the Adviser community. Some of the members may even contribute or suggest tools they have found useful.
<h1><strong>How Can an Adviser Use this for Themselves?</strong></h1>
You can use the MyRightCareer System just as your Advisee will be using it. You can complete the Pre-Requisite Assignment, the six Insights Assignments and finally the Capstone Assignment.

Since the system is self-paced you can work on these Assignments (and exercises within each Assignment) at your own pace. The bulk of the work is completing the six Insights Assignments which contain 15 Exercises. Each Exercise takes about 2.5 hours to complete. Each Exercise has multiple Steps and no Step is longer than 1 hour so they can work on this in 1 hour or shorter increments.

To use the system you can click on the Experienced Adult step at the end of each page.

On that page is  guidance on how you can use this Exercise to identify their own Right Career, as well as an example of someone more like you. In the Examples page there are other examples of Experienced Adults.

It will not be hard for you to dialogue with your Advisee when you have just finished the same Exercises applied to your life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Unlike the Adviser, as a Career Advisory Board Member you will only be meeting with the MyRightCareer Program User three times during the program, not after each Assignment.
<h1><strong>What Does a Board Member Do?</strong></h1>
The Career Advisory Board (CAB) probably never meets as a group. Instead the Program User will meet with you individually. Most of those meetings will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email.
<h3><strong>Review Students Progress Three Times</strong></h3>
A Career Advisory Board Member's main role is reviewing output at three different points in the Program. You only have to meet with your Program User twice during the actual program (CAB #1 and CAB #2):
<ul>
	<li><strong>Career Advisory Board Meeting #1</strong> will be after they finish the first three Insights Assignments: Begin at the End, Look at Self (Personality and Interests) and Look at the Past (Autobiography and Accomplishments).</li>
	<li><strong>Career Advisory Board Meeting #2</strong> will be after they finish the final three Insights Assignments: Strengths (Talents/Strengths and Skills), Meaning (Success Built to Last, Stories, Drivers, How you will Measure Your Life) and Economic Engine (Age 30 &amp; Age 22).</li>
	<li><strong>Career Advisory Board Meeting #3 - Final Review</strong> will be after their Capstone project. They will have identified their Right Career (s), Validated it is really their Right Career, developed their Sales Story and created a Follow-on Plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Provide Feedback to Don</strong></h3>
You can help Don by providing feedback on the program.

You can provide the feedback in two areas:
<ul>
	<li>Program User issues, e.g. they are having trouble summarizing the Assignment/Exercise information, they don't seem to be getting many insights, I think they found their Right Career by Career Advisory Board #1</li>
	<li>Career Advisory Board issues, e.g. if you provided me a tool for ABC it would make my job easier.</li>
</ul>
You can provide the feedback in two different ways: 1) via the Feedback page – there is a Feedback page for every Career Advisory Board meeting (3 for the Program) that contains an on-line Survey, 2) Other – feel free to use whatever is easiest for you, e.g. email, phone.
<h1><strong>Time Required</strong></h1>
There are three Career Advisory Board Meetings and the total time estimate is about 12 hours. Below is the logic for this estimate.

The first two Career Advisory Board Meeting will each be reviewing three Assignments. It is estimated you will spend about 4 hours per Meeting. For every Meeting you will have two types of reviews:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Prior to the Career Advisory Board Meeting (3 hour):</strong> Review the Assignment output they send you. You will probably spend about 1/2 hour per exercise and most Assignments have two exercises, so you will be reviewing six exercises which will take an estimated 3 hours.</li>
	<li><strong>During the Career Advisory Board Meeting (1 hour):</strong> This is most likely a phone call session with just you (not a meeting with the entire Board) and it could last from 1/2 hour to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
</ul>
The last Career Advisory Board Meeting occurs after the Capstone Assignment (identified their Right Career, developed their Sales Story and built a Follow-on Plan). You will have less to review before the Meeting but may have a longer meeting.
<h1><strong>Career Advisory Board Member Support</strong></h1>
There will be information that will help the Career Advisory Board Member in two broad ways.
<h3><strong>General Information:</strong></h3>
There is general information such as this page. There are also scheduling and tracking resources.

If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MyRC-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">Program Schedule Template - pdf</a> you will get the pdf version of a simple Excel scheduling tool. It has a sample that uses movable red boxes to represent the schedule. They may send you their schedule using this tool. At the minimum they will inform you of each Career Advisory Board review sufficiently ahead of time to make a mutually acceptable schedule.
<h3><strong>Exercise Specific Information:</strong></h3>
There are specific resources for each Career Advisory Board review, e.g.
<ul>
	<li>Experienced Adult Examples
On the Adviser Guidance page there will be an Experienced Adult example so they can see an example more like themselves. In the Examples page there are other Experienced Adult examples.</li>
	<li>Assignment Output.
You will provide them with the key outputs for every exercise in the three Assignments they completed prior to the upcoming Career Advisory Board Review. For example, the 1st review will be after they finish the first three Insights Assignments: Begin at the End, Look at Self (Personality and Interests) and Look at the Past (Autobiography and Accomplishments).Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/loot-at-the-past/accomplishments/cab-guide/" target="_blank">Board Member Guidance - Review #1</a>. This is the Board Member Guidance page for the 1st Career Advisory Board Meeting and it will open in a new tab.</li>
	<li>Adviser Guidance on each exercise
It will include an Introduction to the Exercise and the Steps they should be taking with you. It is in the list of Steps for the Exercise and they can also click on any of those Steps to get a full set of Instructions. They can also click on the Short Instructions page for a single page with a few sentences, examples and templates for each Step.There is an Adviser Guidance page for every Exercise that will be reviewed in Career Advisory Board Meeting #1: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography and Accomplishments. Below is the one for Begin at the End exercise.Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end-full-instructions/adviser/" target="_blank">Adviser Guidance - Begin at the End</a> and it will open in a new Tab. Once you have reviewed it you can close the Tab.</li>
</ul>

Each Exercise has multiple Steps and no Step is longer than 1 hour so you can work on this in 1 hour or shorter increments.

To use the system you can click on the Experienced Adult step at the end of each page.

On that page is  guidance on how you can use that Exercise to identify your own Right Career, as well as an example of someone more like you. In the Examples page there are other examples of Experienced Adults.

It will not be hard for you to dialogue with your Advisee when you have just finished applying the process to your life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You should watch the Welcome to Begin at the End video at the minimum. It will give you the basic idea for this exercise and it is less than 5 minutes long.
<ul>
</ul>
If you want to see the instructions for on any step they are available in the menu on the right. You can also look at the Examples page and that is a good way to see what the output should be.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Begin at the End Concept</strong></h1>
So what is the Begin at the End approach? Robert Fritz discovered it when he studied great artists. He found they used this technique to visualize their end result of playing the piano in Carnegie hall and working backwards to their current reality of playing piano in the 4th grade. They then created structural tension between their current reality and a realistic first step. Great athletic coaches use this to visualize winning the league championship and working backwards to their current reality of having just finished a losing season. They then created structural tension between their current reality and a realistic first step. They realized it they did not make it to that first step they were not going to make it to their end result.
<ul>
</ul>
In both cases starting with their current reality (playing piano in the 4th grade or coming off of a losing season) seems so over whelming people are often stuck and can not make any progress. The secret to these successful people is their ability to Visualize the End Result and Work Backwards and then start with some small steps.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Exercise Steps</strong></h1>
This is an exercise I have used in the MyPlanB Workshop with people in their 30's, 40's and 50's. Except with them I let them pick the age. For example they may pick the year their last child goes to college, or the year their last child graduates from college. One way for you to understand this exercise is to do it yourself with your own life. Everyone finds it fascinating and says it provides them with a lot of insight.
<ul>
</ul>
Here are some basic ideas you should keep in mind as your student is doing this exercise. Below are the steps they will complete.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Age 30 Vision:</strong></h3> 
When I say Age 30 I am really recommending they choose an Age that is about 10 years in the future. Most of the students in the Program are about 20 years old so Age 30 is the example I used. 
<ul>
</ul>
If your student is a grad student, someone who recently graduated, someone who just came back from military service, etc they may be 25 years old. You should then have them pick an appropriate age, e.g. 35 years old. In Examples take a look at Elizabeth, she just turned 25 and she used 35 as her end point.
<ul>
</ul>
This is not an exercise in working from today to Age 30. They should forget about today and just visualize their life at Age 30. At that time there will be more to their life than just their job (career). This exercise also allows them to complete the picture with other "Whole Person" parameters. Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Madison-EndResultAge30.pdf"target="_blank">Madison's End Result</a> and you will see an example of the document your student will end up creating. Most students will focus on these elements.
<ul>
</ul>
Casey is used as an example in almost all of the Exercises and she happened to visualize a career at Age 30. If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-EndResult-Age30.pdf" target="_blank">Casey's End Result</a> you will get a pdf file showing Casey's description of her life at Age 30. While she is not so sure about her career choice, she does have some pretty concrete ideas about several Whole Person parameters, e.g. location and personal relationships. Casey is using the MyRightCareer Program to validate her Best Guess and if that turns out to not be true to iterate to another Best Guess.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Working Backwards:</strong></h3> 
Make sure they only picked one category (e.g. Financial, Personal Relationship, Family, Career) and did not try to do this Step with all of the elements in the Age 30 End Result Vision. With that one category they will work backwards from their Ultimate End Result (age 30) to their Intermediate End Result #3 (e.g. age 27) to their Intermediate End Result #2 (e.g. age 24) to their Intermediate End Result #1 (e.g. age 22). They can pick any ages for their Intermediate End Results that make sense for their life. 
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Married-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank">Married at Age 30</a>: This person visualized themselves being married when they were age 30. They wanted to live together two years before getting married. 
<ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-WorkBackwards.pdf" target="_blank"> Casey's Work Backwards</a>: Casey worked backwards from her age 30 career idea to age 22, her graduation from college.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Structural Tension:</strong></h3> 
Now they use the Structural Tension idea and create the objectives (trying to keep them around 5 objectives) that would get them from their Current Reality to their Intermediate End Result #1. If you click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-StructuralTension.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Structural Tension</a> you will get a pdf file of how Casey created a Structural Tension diagram between her Current Reality (summer between her Sophomore & Junior year) and her Intermediate End Result #1 (age 22 = graduation from college). It shows her objectives for those two years.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>MyRightCareer Insights documents:</strong></h3> 
There are five MyRightCareer Insights files: one for "Be Your Best", one for "Meaning & Passion", one for "Fuel Your Economic Engine", one for "Right Career" and one for "Whole Person". This exercise has added a set of insights to each file. By the end of the MyRightCareer Program they will have accumulated a lot of insights that will assist them in identifying their Right Career and preparing their Sales Story.
<ul>
</ul>
These are the most important documents they will be creating during the program. Make sure they are documenting any insights, more is better, they have reached. A lot of time all they have to do is copy the insights from documents they have already created during the exercise, e.g. there is an insights document for their Age 30 Vision.
<ul>
</ul>
These five documents are examples of the insights Casey obtained from completing all the exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography, Accomplishments, Strengths, Skills, Stories, Drivers, How will you Measure Your Life and Economic Engine. From these examples you can see how she has added insights with every exercise. Some of the insights might be the same, just stated in a slightly different way. Or you can have the exact same insights used in multiple circles. In fact that is what you want to see. Then you start to pick up some themes. Click on the links below to see the documents.

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Next Steps</strong></h1>
Your Next Steps should be:

	<li>Look at an example close to your students profile. That will give you a good idea of what your student's final output should resemble.</li>

	<li>See if your student needs any help while they are completing the exercise. You may be able to help them and if not send them to me.</li>

	<li>Check to see their progress via the Begin at the End Checklist which you can find on the Examples page. If they don't already have it you should send them to the Examples page and suggest it as a good tool for communicating their status.</li>

	<li>Once they complete this exercise, review it and then have your dialogue</li>

	<li>Provide me feedback on any insights you have on the student and the Program, as well as any insights on your Adviser role.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>
We would like your feed back on the Begin at the End Assignment. We would also like your feedback on the Adviser role and the support we are providing you. 

We would like you to take the SurveyMonkey survey in this section after you finish your work with your student. Most of the feedback in this survey asks you to agree or disagree with a statement. You have five levels of agreement: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree. Besides that you will have a chance to provide free form textual input.

You can also send Don an email or call him at 650-400-8929.

		<title>Board Guidance - Review #1</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/loot-at-the-past/accomplishments/cab-guide/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Now is time for your student to discuss the results of their first three Assignments: Begin at the End, Look at Self (Personality and Interests) and Look at the Past (Autobiography and Accomplishments), with their Career Advisory Board Members.

The Career Advisory Board probably never meets as a group. Instead the student will meet with each of you individually. Most of those meetings will take place over the phone and much of the content will be shared via email.
<ul>
</ul>
The student will start working on the next Assignment while they are having discussions with their Career Advisory Board members. Due to schedule conflicts it could take several weeks to complete this step and they can be working on the next exercise in parallel.
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Multiple Approaches</strong></h1>
You can approach this review from three basic viewpoints: Applied it to your life, Examined each Exercise and Reviewed their Exercise Output.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Applied MyRightCareer Process to Your Life</strong></h3> 
You will provide the most insightful help to your student if you complete each Assignment (and exercise within that Assignment) before your Career Advisory Board Meeting. It will not be hard to dialogue with your student when you have just finished applying the process to your life.  
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Examined Each Exercise</strong></h3> 
You will better understand their Exercise output if you follow the Adviser Guidance for each Exercise. It will include an Introduction to the Exercise and guidance for each Step. There are links to Examples to make it easier to understand the steps in the Exercise.

Click on <a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/begin-at-the-end/adviser/">Adviser Guidance - Begin at the End</a>. There is an Adviser Guidance page for every exercise.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Reviewed their Exercise Output</strong></h3> 
You can provide them a lot of help by just reviewing the Exercise output they send you. Below are examples of that output and some guidance (summarized from the Adviser Guidance page for each Exercise).
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>The Key Exercise Output</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>
As supporting detail to the MyRightCareer Insights they will most likely send you files from each of the five exercises: Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography and Accomplishments. Below are Casey's examples.
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Begin at the End Assignment</strong></h3>
	
	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-EndResult-Age30.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's End Result</a> This includes her insights as well. Casey identified a possible career at Age 30, you may not have identified one and that is more normal.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Casey-StructuralTension.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Structural Tension</a> This includes her insights as well.</li>

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Look at Self Assignment</strong></h3>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h5><strong>Personality Exercise</strong></h5>
This is Casey's Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the insights she drew from her personality type.

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Look at the Past Assignment</strong></h3>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casey-AutobiographyInsights-.pdf"target="_blank"> Casey's Autobiography Insights</a> </li>
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h5><strong>Accomplishments Exercise</strong></h5>

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Casey-AccomplishmentsInsights.pdf"target="_blank">Casey's Accomplishments Insights</a> </li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>The MyRightCareer Insights Reports</strong></h1>

They will send you the five MyRightCareer Insights files from their last  exercise (Accomplishments): Be Your Best, Meaning & Passion, Economic Engine, Right Career and Whole Person. They only need to send you the files from the last exercise because they are cumulative files and include all their insights from the Begin at the End, Personality, Interests, Autobiography and Accomplishments exercises. 
<ul>
</ul>
For each area, e.g. Be Your Best, you should  have a dialogue about what they have discovered about themselves relative to that element in the Right Career Venn diagram. You should also have a discussion about what they have learned about themselves as a Whole Person, the fifth file.
<ul>
</ul>
Here are Casey's as an example:

<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Next Steps</strong></h1>
	<li>Review Meeting #2: 
The next Career Advisory Board Review will be after your student finishes the next three Assignments: Strengths (Talents/Strengths and Skills), Meaning (Stories, Drivers, How you will Measure Your Life) and Economic Engine (Age 30 & Age 22). 
<ul>
</ul>
If you are use the MyRightCareer process to identify your own right career you should now start on the Strengths (Talents/Strengths and Skills) Assignment.</li>
 
	<li>Review Meeting #3 (Final): The final review will take place after the Capstone Project, where your student will have identified their Right Career (s), developed their Sales Story for that Right Career (s) and created a Follow-on Plan.</li>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>1 - Focus Group Guidance</title>
		<link>http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/focusguide/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
Focus Groups are a good way to find out information in a relatively short period of time with a small investment of resources. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Exercise Assignments</strong></h1>
Each person is only doing three exercises. With the Exercise assignments a six person group, as a whole, will have completed every Exercise and is better prepared to provide input at the Focus Group Meeting. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li><h4><strong><a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Goucher-Focus-Group-V1.pdf"target="_blank">MyRightCareer Exercise Assignments</a></strong></H4></li>
<ul>
</ul>
In the table the rows are the Exercises and the columns are the Students. A student will find their column and look down it for the rows (Exercises) in which there is a number. That number is the hours it is estimated to take to complete that Exercise. Under their name is the total hours to complete the Exercises assigned to them. Right below the number of hours is the # of Exercises they have been assigned. On average each of them will be investing 10 hours spread over 3 Exercises (plus the Pre-Requisite) in the Pre Focus Meeting work. 

Once they are on the MyRightCareer System they can find their assigned Exercises by seeing which Assignment it is part of (these are the words across the top of the Home screen), e.g. 
<ul>
</ul>
	<li>Define your Age 30 Vision is part of <strong>End</strong></li>

	<li>Personality is part of <strong>Self</strong></li>

	<li>Autobiography & Accomplishments are in <strong>Past</strong></li>
 
	<li>Skills & Strengths/Talents are in <strong>Strengths</strong></li>

	<li>Stories, Drivers & Measure Your Life are in <strong>Meaning</strong></li>

	<li>Age 30 Budget & Age 22 Budget are in <strong>Econ</strong></li>

	<li>Right Careers, Validate Right Careers, Sales Story & Follow-on Plan are in <strong>Capstone</strong></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Common Duties</strong></h1>
As with the major Internships, the Focus Groups have the same two Common Duties - Providing Feedback and Providing Exercise Examples. Except a member of a Focus Group is only completing 3 Exercises.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Provide Exercise Feedback</strong></H4> 
We want your feedback on each Exercise. There will be an online survey to provide feedback on each Exercise immediately after completion. The feedback will be in two categories. 

Quantitative, e.g. Chose one from (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree) for a statement such as "For the skills exercise the written instructions did a good job of explaining how to do the exercise." 

Qualitative/Free Form, e.g. "Please provide additional explanation for your answer to the above question." We want to capture your feedback in real time because it is harder to remember what happened in an Exercise when you move on and complete the next Exercise. You are also welcome to communicate directly with Don via email or phone at any time.
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Provide Exercise Examples</strong></H4>
We want to use your completed exercises as examples in the Program. As you will see the Program relies heavily on examples as the way to "Explain" how to complete an exercise. 

Your completed exercises will be changed to disguise your identify. For example, you will be asked to pick a "stage name" and that will be used for your exercise. In addition, personal details will be edited out of your completed exercises. You will have review rights of the examples before they are used and can either request changes or refuse to have specific exercise examples used. 
<ul>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Pre Focus Group Meeting Work</strong></h1>
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
This is a short course on the Success Built to Last research. It provides the research findings that support the Meaning & Passion circle in the Right Career Venn diagram.

•	<strong>Create meaning and passion in your life</strong>

•	Be your best

•	Fuel the “economic engine” that leads to financial security

Click on each topic to see a video clip from two of the co-authors of Success Built to Last as they explain the findings of their research. These are video clips from their TV program. This course is about 20 minutes of that hour long program.

<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/1-Introduction.mov"target="_blank"> Introduction</a></h4>
People who achieve lasting success are more rare and the authors set out to find out what sets them apart. Hear the author's explain how they found these people and discovered their secrets to building success that lasts.</li>

<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/2_what_is_success.mov"target="_blank"> What is Success</a></h4>
These 200 people look at success differently.

<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/3sc-Won't Settle (8 min).mov"target="_blank"> Won't Settle</a></h4>
Hear the author's talk about why these people won't settle for anything that doesn't provide them with meaning. Also hear Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines, as he talks about the role passion plays in success.

<li><h4><a href="http://myplanb.org/media/4sc-Passion & Love (4.5 min).mov"target="_blank"> Passion & Love</a></h4>
The authors relate Maya Angelou's (author, poet & performer) view of the role passion plays in success. They also describe how this view is also shared by enduring successful CEO's. Hear Warren Buffet explain why you shouldn't wait to pursue your Right Career.

<h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4>

The author's research lead to two main conclusions:

<strong>What you do must have Meaning,i.e. what you do must matter deeply to you</strong>. It’s something you’re so passionate about that you lose all track of time when you do it. In fact it may not feel like work at all. It seduces you to the point where you lose interest in everything else.
<ul>
</ul>
<strong>The bad news is that it’s really dangerous not to do what you love.</strong> The harsh truth is that if you don’t love what you’re doing, you’ll lose to someone who does. Your co-workers or competitors who love their work will gladly work longer hours, think about work 24/7, try more things, come up with more great ideas and get better opportunities than people who only do things for a living.
<ul>
</ul>
While you should take each module in the order shown, each one stands alone so they could be taken at different times during the day or on different days. The total length of the Success Built to Last course is approximately 20 minutes.
<ul>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
There are many ways to Validate the career (s) you identified are your Right Career (s). At the minimum you need to do the following two. First you need to search for more information about that right career and build up a storehouse of knowledge. Second you need to identify some people in that field who would allow you to have an Informational Interview. One of the reasons for doing the first task, research the field, is to appear knowledgeable and interested when you have your Information Interviews.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[College students want to know what courses and majors will give them an edge in their careers. But the choices are not always clear, even if you are taking advice from Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.

In a talk to the nation's governors earlier this month, Mr. Gates emphasized work-related learning, arguing that education investment should be aimed at academic disciplines and departments that are "well-correlated to areas that actually produce jobs."

If this was not music to the ears of advocates of the humanities, they quickly found a soul mate in Steve Jobs. At an event unveiling new Apple products, Mr. Jobs said: "It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough -- it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing and nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devices."

What do we know about the relationship between college studies and majors and future employment? What gets you a good first job and what leads to career success?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Success Built to Last" forms the foundation for the Meaning & Passion circle.  The authors (Jerry Porras, Stewart Emery, and Mark Thompson) based their results on the video interviews of 200 successful people, from CEOs to Nobel Laureates to community leaders. They found to achieve true lasting success what you do must have meaning, i.e. what you do must matter deeply to you. They also found it is dangerous to not do what you love because you will lose out to colleagues and competitors who truly love their work.

There are at least four video clips that you should find interesting at the link below: "What is Success", "What Successful People are Missing", "Make More Mistakes" and "Be a Good One".   <a href="http://www.successbuilttolast.com/see-speech-Stewart-Emery.html" target="_blank">Check out the videos! </a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You are going to use the same instructions and templates the students use to complete this exercise. The differences from the student are:
<ul>
	<li>You can also use the Experienced Adult examples described on this page and shown on the Examples page</li>
	<li>You will get some specific guidance as to how to change the Age 30 Vision to a more appropriate age for your situation.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Examples</strong></h1>
Below are two examples that can be of value to you when using the MyRightCareer System for your own life. Bud's example has much more detail than Mary's example. The amount of detail you put into your output is entirely up to you.

There are more Experienced Adult examples at the end of the Examples page, which you can access from the Sub Navigation Panel on the right. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.

<strong>End Result</strong>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mary-TimeLine.pdf" target="_blank"> Mary's Time Line.</a> She selected the year her twins leave for college. This is 5 years from her current situation.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mary-End-Result.pdf" target="_blank"> Mary's End Result</a> She picked six key parameters.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bud-Timeline.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's Time Line.</a> He selected the year his son, his youngest child, graduated from high school. This was 7 years in the future and also the time his daughter was scheduled to graduate from college.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bud-End-Result.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's End Result</a> He picked eight key parameters.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bud-2013-VisionBoard.jpg" target="_blank">Bud's 2013 Vision Board</a> you will see it basically has one picture for each of the nine items in the End Result document.

<strong>Working Backwards</strong>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mary-Work-Backwards.pdf" target="_blank"> Mary's Work Backwards</a>: Mary worked backwards from her Ultimate End Result (Age 56) to her Current Reality (Age 51).

<strong>Structural Tension</strong>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mary-Structural-Tension.pdf" target="_blank"> Mary's Structural Tension</a>: Mary created a document showing the relationship between her Current Reality and her Intermediate End Result #1.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mary-Struct-Tension-Obj.pdf" target="_blank"> Mary's Structural Tension Objectives</a>: Mary created five Objectives she feels she needs to achieve to move from her Current Reality to her Intermediate End Result #1.

He shows just one of the items, his personal situation, and creates a Vision of what he wants it to be when his son graduates from high school.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bud-IER1Goals1.pdf" target="_blank"> Bud's Structural Tension Objectives</a>: Bud created five Objectives he feels he needs to achieve to move from his Current Reality to his Intermediate End Result #1, for just his Personal Situation. This is the first step toward the Vision displayed on the Vision Board - having someone next to him at his son's high school graduation.
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Instructions</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Instructions and Templates</strong></h4>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">You should use the same templates the students use. Previously the participants used an Excel spreadsheet but I have found most people do better with Word. Plus there are good instructions for those new Word templates and you should follow the same instructions the students are using.</span>
<h4><strong>Major Difference - Age X vs. Age 30 Vision</strong></h4>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">This is an exercise that is used with people in their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. Except they pick the age. For example they may pick the year their last child goes to college, or the year their last child graduates from college. Some people just pick a year, e.g. when I turn 50 or when I turn 60. Everyone finds this exercise fascinating and says it provides them with a lot of insight.</span>
<h1><strong>Next Steps</strong></h1>
Your Next Steps should be:
<h4><strong>Choose your Instruction approach</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Short Instructions: If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically reading a couple of sentences of instructions and using examples to do your work. You can also jump to a full instructions version of any step if you find you need more help.</li>
	<li>Full Instructions: If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the approximately 6 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.</li>
	<li>Hybrid: You can start with the Short Instructions and then when you feel one of the Steps requires more instructions you can switch to the Full Instructions approach for that Step. After that step you can switch back to the Short Instructions approach for the rest of the Instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Get Started with the Exercise</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Short Instructions: Click on "Short Instructions" in the Sub Navigation menu on the upper right</li>
	<li>Full Instructions: Click on "Step 0 - Introduction" in the Sub Navigation menu on the upper right</li>

You are going to use the same instructions and templates the students use to complete this exercise. The differences from the student are:
<ul>
	<li>You can also use the Experienced Adult examples described on this page and shown on the Examples page</li>
	<li>You will get some specific guidance as to how to change the Age 30 Vision to a more appropriate age for your situation.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Examples</strong></h1>
Below are two examples that can be of value to an Adviser or Career Advisory Board Member if you want to use the MyRightCareer System for your own life. Matt (ENTJ) and Bud (INTJ) will be more relevant than the college student examples. You will notice Matt and Bud's output is slightly different than the students.

There are more Experienced Adult examples at the end of the Examples page, which you can access from the Sub Navigation Panel on the right. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.
<h3><strong>Bud - INTJ</strong></h3>
<strong>I (Introversion) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I focus on the inner world of ideas and impressions
<strong>N (Intuition) - Clarity is Clear:</strong> I take in information from patterns and the big picture and focus on future possibilities
<strong>T (Thinking) - Clarity is Moderate, almost Clear</strong>: I make decisions based on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect
<strong>J (Judging) - Clarity is Very Clear:</strong> I like a planned and organized approach, plus I want to have things settled

<h3><strong>Matt - ENTJ</strong></h3>
<strong>E (Extraversion) - Clarity is Very Clear</strong>: I focus on the outer world of people and activity
<strong>N (Intuition) - Clarity is Moderate</strong>: I take in information from patterns and the big picture and focus on future possibilities
<strong>T (Thinking) - Clarity is Slight</strong>: I make decisions based on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect

<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Instructions</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Instructions and Templates</strong></h3>
You should use the same instructions and templates the students use.
<h3><strong>Differences</strong></h3>
<strong>Combined Myers-Brigss and Strong Interest Inventory Assessment</strong>
The combined Myers-Brigss and Strong Interest Inventory Assessment is $99. You should be able to take it from your college's Career Center, most of them are eager to support Alumni. If not then click on "Step 1 - Take Assessments" in the Sub Navigation panel on the right for instructions on paying for it yourself.

Many people have taken a Myers-Briggs assessment sometime in their career. If so compare your previous Type (if you still have the assessment or can remember it) to this one. I bet they are the same.

<strong>"Do What You Are" Report</strong>
If your Career Center does not provide the “Do What You Are” Report or will not support an Alumni, you will have to pay for it ($29). If they don't provide the report then click on "Step 2 - "Do What You Are" in the Sub Navigation panel on the right for instructions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The best hope of spotting these hidden winners was to steal a quick peek at the bottom of the résumé.

At Google, Todd Carlisle is director of staffing. In 2005, he began an experiment, collecting factors that might distinguish between hiring great employees and picking the wrong people. Within a few months, Carlisle had some answers. Most supposed markers of success turned out to be mirages.

The best hope of spotting these hidden winners, Carlisle came to believe, was to steal a quick peek at the bottom of the résumé. He became known as the man who analyzed them “upside down.” Now, when Carlisle pulls one up on his laptop—which happens dozens of times a day—he begins by tapping the “Page Down” key a couple times until he reaches the final entries.

Then he scrutinizes the loose ends of candidates’ bios. “I want to know their stories,” Carlisle explained one morning. “I want to know what these people are all about.” In a moment, he might start hunting for the classic markers of competence: work history, education, credentials, and the like. But first he wants to see if some special, rare attribute could point the way to greatness.

You are going to use the same instructions and templates the students use to complete this exercise. The differences from the student is you can also use the Experienced Adult example described on this page, as well as the ones shown on the Examples page.
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Examples</strong></h1>
Bud's example will be more relevant than the college student examples. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.

There are more Experienced Adult examples at the end of the Examples page, which you can access from the Sub Navigation Panel on the right. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-Transitions.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's Transitions and Insights</a>. Bud included his Transition Insights in this file.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-CareerDecisions.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's Career Decisions and Mistakes</a>. Bud did an extensive analysis of all 17 of his career decisions, starting with which college to attend. He narrowed them down to major (9 of the 17) and really major (6 of the 17). For each career decision he looked at the major alternative (s) he considered. Then he documented the Mistakes he has made and the Insights he has gained.
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Instructions</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Instructions and Templates</strong></h3>
You should use the same instructions and templates the students use.
<h3><strong>Difference - </strong><strong>Career Decisions and Mistakes Exercise</strong></h3>
This exercise isn’t really useful for a college student, but is very valuable for a mid-life professional.
<ul>
	<li>1st you need to itemize all of the career decisions you feel you have made in your life. You will notice in Bud's example above he decided his first career decision was choosing the college to attend. He also identified 17 career decisions.</li>
	<li>2nd you need to narrow your career decisions down to the major ones. In Bud's example above he decided 9 of the 17 were Major career decisions. Because he still had quite a few Major career decisions he went one step further and identified the really major career decisions (6 of the 17).</li>
	<li>3rd for each of the major alternatives look at the alternative (s) you considered when you made that career decision. Think about how you made that career decision.</li>
	<li>4th you need to document the career Mistakes you have made and the Insights you have gained from your Career Decisions.</li>
</ul>
Most likely you will face more career decisions in the future and this will give you some insights into your decision criteria and approach.
<h1><strong>Next Steps</strong></h1>
Your Next Steps should be:
<h4><strong>Choose your Instruction approach</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Short Instructions: If you are the type of person who only needs a very minor amount of explanation and some examples the Short Instructions Approach will probably work just fine. It is basically reading a couple of sentences of instructions and using examples to do your work. You can also jump to a full instructions version of any step if you find you need more help.</li>
	<li>Full Instructions: If you would like a full set of instructions, which includes the approximately 6 minute video and instructions with multiple examples integrated into the text, then the Full Instructions Approach will work better.</li>
	<li>Hybrid: You can start with the Short Instructions and then when you feel one of the Steps requires more instructions you can switch to the Full Instructions approach for that Step. After that step you can switch back to the Short Instructions approach for the rest of the Instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Get Started with the Exercise</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Short Instructions: Click on "Short Instructions" in the Sub Navigation menu on the upper right</li>
	<li>Full Instructions: Click on "Step 0 - Introduction" in the Sub Navigation menu on the upper right</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
You are going to use the same instructions and templates the students use to complete this exercise. The differences from the student is you can also use the Experienced Adult example described on this page, as well as the ones shown on the Examples page.
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Examples</strong></h1>
Bud's example will be more relevant than the college student examples. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.

There are more Experienced Adult examples at the end of the Examples page, which you can access from the Sub Navigation Panel on the right. If you want to complete this use the same templates the students use.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-AllAccList_Age44.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's All Accomplishments List</a>
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bud-Major-Acc-Top-7-Age-44.pdf" target="_blank">Bud's Top 7 Accomplishments List</a>
<h1><strong>Experienced Adult Instructions</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Instructions and Templates</strong></h3>
You should use the same instructions and templates the students use.
<h3><strong>Difference</strong><strong>
</strong></h3>
You will notice the experienced adults had to choose which of many accomplishments (e.g. Bud had 10 from elementary school through grad school, 41 from grad school to age 44 and 4 that were purely personal, e.g. becoming a father) they want to call their Major Accomplishments. Bud then chose 7 Major Accomplishments out of all of that large group. Most students have the opposite problem, trying to find enough accomplishments to reach the suggested total.

<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills.pdf" target="_blank">Skills List</a> Bud used the same O*NET system the college students use to identify his skills, i.e. he picked them from the list provided by the O*NET system.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Skills-Occupations-List.pdf" target="_blank">Occupations List</a> The O*NET system then produced a list of Occupations that use those skills. The list starts with the occupations that use the most of his skills and then goes down. Bud highlighted in yellow the occupations of most interest to him.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-Matched.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Skills Required vs. Bud's Skills</a> The O*NET System produces a report showing the skills required for the CEO role and then shows which of those Bud has. There is a similar report for the Treasurer-Controller role. One of the skills Bud lacks for both roles is Active Listening.
<a href="http://www.my-right-career-content.com/rose-dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bud-Chief-Executives-Skills-SummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank">CEO Summary Report</a> The O*NET System has a comprehensive report for each Occupation. It has links at the end to other information about that Occupation.
